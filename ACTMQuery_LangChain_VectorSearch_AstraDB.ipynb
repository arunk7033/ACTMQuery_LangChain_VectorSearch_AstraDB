HEADQUARTERS OFFICE  \\n10100  Introduction  \\nElectrification on Indian Railways remained mainly confined to following sections, till early fifties, at \\n1500 V dc: -  \\n1.    Suburban Railways in Bombay  \\ni) Central Railway  \\na) Bombay VT -Kalyan (main l ine)  \\nb) Bombay VT -Kurla (Harbour Branch)   \\nii)  Western Railway  \\na)   Churchgate -Virar  \\n2.   Ghat Sections of Central Railway)  \\ni)   Kalyan -Pune  \\nii)   Kalyan -Igatpuri  \\n \\n3.   MG Suburban Sections of Madras  \\ni)   Madras Egmore -Tambaram section  of Southern Railwa y.  \\n \\nBefore large scale electrification was thought of on Eastern Railway, the suburban section of \\nHowrah -Burdwan was electrified at 3000 V dc.  \\n \\nIn the meantime SNCF (Socieite National Chemin de Fer Francais, i.e., French National Railways) \\nhad gone ahead  with large scale main line electrification on their system with 25 kV, 50 Hz, ac, \\nSNCF, who worked as Technical Consultants to Indian Railways for adopting a system of \\nelectrification on main line, recommended 25 kV, 50 Hz system as technically viable and  \\neconomical for Indian Railways. Since then the entire electrification on Indian Railways has been \\ncarried out on 25 kV, 50 Hz, ac only. The first electrification on 25 kV, 50 Hz ac was taken up on \\nSouth Eastern Railway between Rajkharaswan and Dongaposi. Even the Howrah -Burdwan section \\non Eastern Railway and Madras - Tambaram section on Southern Railway were later on converted \\nto 25 kV, 50 HZ ac system. As on 31.3.94, a total of 11793 Route Kilometer have been electrified on \\n25 kV, 50 Hz ac single phase sy stem.  \\n \\n1500 V dc system is, however, retained on Central and Western Railways, even though further \\nelectrification on these two Railways was done on 25 kV, 50 Hz, ac single phase system primarily \\nbecause of problems of clearances in tunnels and interferen ce with telecommunication lines in the \\nsuburban section. The system compatibility was obtained by providing either dual system yard with \\nneutral sections at either end (as in Central Railway) or by using dual voltage locomotives (as in \\nWestern Railway).  \\n \\n10101  Chief Electrical Engineer (CEE) -Zonal Railway  \\n \\nCEE is the Administrative Head of the Electrical Department, with overall responsibility for efficient \\nworking of the department. He is responsible to the General Manager in all matters pertaining to \\nElectric Traction and Electrical General Services. On behalf of the General Manager, he directs and \\nsupervises all electrical works related to Railway, whether executed by Divisional Officer or by \\nindependent organisation. He oversees the budget of the Elec trical Department and is also \\nresponsible for works to be executed by the department.  \\n \\nCEE also functions as Electrical Inspector to the Government as defined in Section 36(1) of Indian \\nElectricity Act - 1910, in respect of all high voltage electrical inst allations and equipment owned by \\nthe Railways. This includes all high voltage electrical installations in the Railway including \\ntransmission lines, 25 kV feeder lines, sub -stations, switching stations which although running \\noutside Railway premises, are, n evertheless, owned by the Railway. He is responsible for \\nadministration of the Electricity Rules in the Railway.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME I      [3] In regard to electric traction installations, in his capacity as Electrical Inspector, CEE is chiefly responsible for \\nthe following: -  \\n \\n \\n1. Scrutiny and approval of the layout and designs for sub -stations, OHE and other installations for \\ncompliance with the Indian Electricity Act and Rules;  \\n \\n2. Inspection of the completed installations, ei ther personally or by deputing his officers, for compliance \\nwith the safety requirements;  \\n \\n3. Approval for the energization of the Installations;  \\n \\n4. Statutory inspection of the installations periodically under Rule 46 of the Indian Electricity Rules;  \\n \\n5. Investigation of electrical accidents and Issuing directives to prevent their recurrence; and  \\n \\n6. Submission of annual report to Central Electricity Authority.  \\n \\n10102  Control Over Division  \\n \\nIn all technical matters, the Senior Divisional Electrical Engineers (Sr. DEEs) in the Division are \\nanswerable to CEE.  \\n \\n10103 Duties of Administrative Officers  \\n \\nCEE is assisted by one or more officers of Senior Administrative rank, who will be responsible to CEE for the \\nproper working of the department, the area  of responsibility of each will be defined by CEE.  \\n \\nAdministrative Officers will :  \\n \\na) Normally deal with all correspondence except those involving important policy matters and expression of \\nopinion on behalf of the Railway on major matters of policy;  \\n \\nb) On behalf of CEE, exercise administrative and technical control for the efficient planning, design, \\nconstruction, commissioning, safe and economic operation and effective periodic maintenance of electric \\ntraction services, Train Lighting, Air Conditioni ng on Coaches, General Power Services in Railway premises \\nand equipment owned by the Railway and to achieve this, carry out purposeful periodic inspection of \\ninstallations;  \\n \\nc) In the event of major breakdowns/accidents, take prompt and energetic action t o restore normal services at \\nthe earliest possible time and subsequently take follow -up action to investigate the cause of failure and initiate \\nmeasures to prevent recurrence;  \\nd) Co -ordinate effectively with Administrative Officers of operating and other departments on the Railway and \\nalso their counterparts in other Railways in regard to items of common interest;  \\ne) Maintain liaison with the Power -Supply Authorities at Headquarters level In regard to continuity of supply, \\ntariff and policy matters;  \\nf) Ke ep a close watch over the day -to-day performance of traction services and tighten up preventive \\nmaintenance where required;  \\n \\ng) Investigate equipment failures, particularly of recurring nature, initiate appropriate remedial steps to modify \\nthe design wher ever required In consultation with the Research, Designs and Standards Organisation \\n(RDSO), Locomotive manufacturers; also take follow -up action to ensure prompt completion of modifications \\nordered on all equipment held by the Railway;  \\n \\nh)  Plan and revie w the organizational set -up required for satisfactory maintenance and operation of the \\nelectric traction services;  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME I      (4)  i)Plan the recruitment and training of staff for maintenance and operation;  \\n \\nj) Exercise effective technical scrutiny over items for inclusion in the M&P, Works and Rolling Stock \\nProgrammes and progress items approved in the programmes;  \\n \\nk) Plan in advance the procurement of vital stores required for maintenance and operation of electr ic \\ntraction services and maintain effective liaison with the Stores Department at Headquarters level for \\nprompt procurement and adequate stocking of such stores;  \\n \\nl) Arrange for standardization of stores as required and preparation of drawings and specifi cations to \\nfacilitate procurement;  \\n \\nm) Study and analyze the periodic statistical returns on electric traction and initiate appropriate \\nremedial measures as required to improve efficiency;  \\n \\nn) Monitor energy consumption, power factor and Maximum Demand a t various traction sub -stations \\non the Railway and initiate appropriate measures to ensure efficient utilization of energy and to \\ncontain the energy bill;  \\n \\no) Ensure the prompt submission of periodical returns to the Railway Board and RDSO;  \\n \\np) Budgeting  and control over expenditure, particularly in regard to repair costs, energy bills and \\nmaximum demand charges;  \\n \\nq) Carry out studies regarding the feasibility and economics of electrification of additional sections In \\nconsultation with the Operating and Accounts Departments and submission of proposals to the \\nBoard where found justifiable;  \\n \\nr) Keep in touch with modern technical developments with a view to identify applicability in railway \\ninstallations to reduce operation and maintenance cost;  \\n \\ns) Maint ain liaison with the Railways for quick return of overdue locomotives;  \\n \\nt) Maintain close co -ordination with production units and POH workshops for supply of shop \\nmanufac - tured items, reducing POH time and improving reliability.  \\n \\n10104 Stores Procuremen t  \\n \\nAn important responsibility on the Headquarters and Divisional Offices is to ensure by timely action \\nthat sufficient stocks of stores and spares are actually held not only for meeting the day -to-day \\nneeds of maintenance and repair, but also for any eme rgency such as thefts of overhead \\nconductors, uprooting of OHE masts on account of accidents, or to meet urgent operational \\nrequirements such as wiring of additional lines in a yard.  \\n \\nNumber of component parts involved in rolling stock and OHE maintenance  is quite large and each \\nof them should comply with rigid specifications, being of special nature. Reliable sources of supply \\nare also limited.

The additional energy consumption may be computed on the basis \\nof the specific energy consumption actually  obtained for different services on the Railway during the \\nprevious six months. Where maximum demand payment is involved, the additional maximum \\ndemand for budgetting purposes may be assumed to be in proportion to the anticipated additional \\nenergy consumpt ion if the pattern of train working remains unchanged.

E. Railway  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS — AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1 CHAPTER II  \\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF FIXED INSTALLATIONS  \\n1. POWER SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AT SUB -STATIONS  \\n \\n10200 Power Supply  \\n25 kV, ac, 50 Hz single phase power supply for electric traction is derived from the grid system of \\nState Elect ricity Boards through traction sub -stations located along the route of the electrified \\nsections at distances of 35 to 50 km apart. The distance between adjacent sub -stations may \\nhowever be even less depending on intensity of traffic and load of trains.  \\n \\nAt present there are broadly four different arrangements in existence as under : - \\n \\n1. The Supply Authorities supply power at 220/132/110/66 kV Extra High Voltage (EHV) at each \\ntraction sub -station which is owned, installed, operated and maintained by the Ra ilway\\';  \\n \\n2. The Railway receives 3 -phase power supply from the Supply Authority at a single point near the \\ngrid sub - station, from where the Railway runs its own transmission lines providing its own traction \\nsub-stations;  \\n \\n3. All EHV and 25 kV equipment is owned, installed, operated, and maintained by the Supply \\nAuthority, except 25 kV feeder circuit breakers which are owned, installed, operated and maintained \\nby the Railway;  \\n \\n4. All EHV and 25 kV equipment is owned, installed, operated and maintained by  the Supply \\nAuthority but 25 kV feeder circuit breakers alone are operated on remote control by the Traction \\nPower Controller (TPC).  \\n \\n10201 Duplicate Supply  \\n1. Fig. 2.01 shows schematically the arrangement at a typical traction sub -station.  \\n \\n2. To ensur e continuity of supply under all conditions, the high voltage feed to the traction \\nsubstations is invariably arranged either from two sources of power or by a double circuit \\ntransmission line, so that even if one source fails, the other remains in service.  Suitable protective \\nequipment is installed at the sub -stations to ensure rapid isolation of any fault in transmission lines \\nand sub -station equipment, so that the power supply for electric traction is maintained under all \\nconditions.  \\n \\n3. At each traction  sub-station, normally two single -phase transformers are installed, one of which is \\nin service and the other is 100% stand by. The present standard capacity is 21.6 MVA (ONAN)/30.2 \\nMVA (ONAF). However transformers of capacity 13.5 MVA (ONAN)/I0.8 MVA (ONAN ) have also \\nbeen used at many of the sub -stations. These transformers step down the grid voltage to 25 kV for \\nfeeding the traction overhead equipment (OHE). 25 kV feeders carry the power from the sub -\\nstations to feeding posts located near the tracks. Each feeder is controlled by a single -pole circuit \\nbreaker equipped with protective devices.  \\n \\n10202 Voltage Regulation  \\nThe permissible variation of the bus bar voltage on the busbars at the grid sub -station is+ \\n10% and –5% i.e., between 27,500 V. and 23,750 V . The tappings on the transformers are \\non the secondary winding and are set to ensure that the voltage is maintained as high as \\npossible but not exceeding 27.5 kV at the feeding post at any time.  \\n \\n10203     25 kV Supply at Traction Sub -stations  \\n1. On the  secondary side, one transformer circuit breaker and one feeder circuit breaker are \\ninstalled with associated double pole isolator, the busbar connections being such that full flexibility \\nof operation is assured.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOL UME      (14)   \\n 2. The traction sub -station is designed for remote operation.  \\n \\n3.   The facilities exist to change over from one feeder to the other by means of isolator/bus coupler.  \\n \\n4.   One end of the secondary winding of the transformer is solidly earthed at the sub -station and is \\nconnected to track/return feeder through buried rail.  \\n \\n10204Feeding and Sectioning Arrangements  \\n \\n1. The generation and transmission systems of Supply Authorities are 3 -phase systems. The single -\\nphase traction load causes unbalance in the supply system. This unbalance has undesirable effects \\non the generators of the Supply Authorities and equipment of other consumers, if its value becomes \\nexcessive.  \\n \\n2. The permissible voltage unbalance at the point  of common coupling on the grid supply system \\nshould not exceed the following limits: -  \\n \\nVoltage Unbalance                           (%)  \\nInstantaneous                                    5  \\n2 hours     3 \\nContinuous              2 \\n  \\n3. To keep the unbalance on the 3 -phase grid system within the above limits, power for ac single \\nphase traction is tapped off the grid system across the different phases at adjacent sub -stations in \\ncyclic order.  \\n \\n4. Thus it becomes necessary to separate electrically the overhead equipment systems fed by \\nadjacent sub - stations. This is done by providing a \\'Neutral Section\\' between two sub -stations on the \\noverhead equipment to ensure that the two phases are not bridged by the pantographs of passing \\nelectric locomotives/EMUs.  \\n \\n5. To  ensure rapid isolation of faults on the OHE and to facilitate maintenance work, the OHE is  \\nsectioned at intervals of 10 to 15 km along the route. At each such point a \\'switching station \\ninterruptors\\' usually rated at 600A are provided. The shortest sectio n of the OHE, which can be \\nisolated by opening interruptors alone is called a \\'sub -sector\\'. Each sub -sector is further sub -divided \\ninto smaller \\'elementary sections\\' by provision of off -load type manually operated isolator switches.  \\n \\n6. At some stations w ith large yards, alternative feeding arrangements are provided so that the \\npower for feeding and yards may be drawn from alternative routes. Normally the switch is locked in \\none position, being changed to the other when required after taking necessary prec autions.  \\n \\n7. To meet requirements at electric loco running sheds isolators with earthing device in the ‘off’ \\npositions is provided. At watering stations manually operated interrupters and isolator with earthing \\nheels are provided to enable switching off o f the power supply locally and earthing the OHE to \\nenable working on roofs of rolling -stock. There are several types of switching stations as detailed in \\nthe following paras.  \\n \\n10205  Feeding Post (FP)  \\nEach feeder supplies the OHE on one side of the feedi ng post through interruptors  controlling \\nsupply to the individual lines. Thus, for a two track line, there will be four  interruptors at each \\nfeeding post.  \\n \\n10206 Sectioning and Paralleling Post (SP)  \\nThese posts are situated approximately midway between  feeding posts marking the demarcating \\npoint of two zones fed from different phases from adjacent sub -stations. At these posts, a neutral \\nsection is provided to make  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME     (16)  \\n  it impossible for the pantogra ph of an electric locomotive or EMU train to bridge - the different \\nPhases of 25 kV supply, while passing from the zone fed from one sub -station to the next one. \\nSince the neutral section remains \\'dead\\', warning boards are provided in advance to warn and \\nremind the Driver of an approaching electric locomotive/EMU to open locomotive circuit breaker \\n(DJ) before approaching the \\'neutral section\\', to coast through it and then switch \\'on\\' on the other \\nside. Special care is taken infixing the location of neutral s ections, on level tangent tracks far away \\nfrom signals, level crossing gates etc. to ensure that the train coasts through the, neutral section at \\na sufficiently high speed, to obviate the possibility of its stopping and getting stuck within the neutral \\nsection.  \\n \\nA paralleling interruptor is provided at each \\'SP\\' to parallel the OHE of the up and down tracks of a \\ndouble track section. \\'bridging  interruptors\\' are also provided to permit one feeding post to feed \\nbeyond the sectioning post upto the next FP if  its 25 kV supply is interrupted for some reasons. \\nThese bridging interruptors are normally kept open and should only be closed after taking special \\nprecautions as detailed in these rules.  \\n \\n10207  Sub -Sectioning and Paralleling Post (SSP)  \\n \\nOne or more SS Ps are provided between each FP and adjacent SP depending upon the distance \\nbetween them. In a double track section, normally three interruptors are provided at each SSP i.e. \\ntwo connecting the adjacent sub -sectors of up and down tracks and one for paralle ling the up and \\ndown tracks.  \\n \\n10208 Sub -Sectioning Post (SS)  \\n \\nThese are provided only occasionally. They are similar to SSPs with provision for sectioning of the \\nOHE but not paralleling.  \\n \\n10209 Certain Equipment at Switching Stations  \\n \\nCertain equipment s are installed at various points to protect the lines, to monitor the availability of \\npower supply and provide other facilities. These are generally as under : -  \\n \\n1. Lightning arresters are provided to protect every sub -sector against voltage surges.  \\n \\n2. Auxiliary transformers are provided at all the posts and also at certain intermediate points to \\nsupply ac at 240 V, 50 Hz required for signalling and operationally essential lighting installations. To \\nensure a fairly steady voltage, automatic voltage regul ators are also provided where required.  \\n \\n3. Potential transformers are provided at the various switching stations for monitoring supply to each \\nsub-sector.  \\n \\n4. A small masonry cubicle is provided to accommodate remote control equipment, control panel, \\ntelephone and batteries and battery chargers required for the control of interruptors and other \\nsimilar equipments.  \\n \\nII. POWER SUPPLY FOR SIGNALLING  \\n10210 Supply Arrangements  \\n \\n1. To ensure reliability of ac 240V, supply through 25 kV/240V auxiliary transfo rmer by tapping 25 \\nkV OHE is made available at following places:  \\n \\n(a)   At each way side station for CLS.  \\n(b) Level crossings located more than 2 km.away from Railway Station.  \\n(C) At IBH.  \\n(d) At all the power supply installations.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC T RACTION MANUAL  VOLUME 1     (17)  2. In the event of power block being given on both the OHE sub -sectors from which the signal \\nsupply is derived, electric traffic would necessarily have to be suspended on the line. During such \\nperiods, colour light signal ling will not also be in operation. Such cases are likely to arise very rarely \\nat any station and the duration of the block is not likely to exceed -one hour at a time. Therefore, no \\nadditional power supply arrangement need be made by the Electrical Departm ent at wayside \\nstations. However, to cater for this condition, portable -generating sets should be kept by the S&T \\nDepartment to be operated until 25 kV supply is restored. At large stations with considerable \\nshunting movements, a stand -by diesel generator set may be installed by the S&T Department to \\nmeet emergencies, if considered essential.  \\n \\n10211 Voltage Regulators  \\n \\nThe fluctuating nature of traction load causes perceptible fluctuation on the ac 240 V supply \\naffecting operation of signalling equipment.  To overcome this, static type voltage regulators are \\nprovided by the S&T Department to limit voltage fluctuations to + 5%. These voltage regulators are \\ninstalled either in separate kiosks inside the remote control cubicles, inside the ASM\\'s room, or \\ninside the cabins depending upon the position of various load centres.  \\n \\nIII. REMOTE CONTROL AND COMMUNICATION ARRANGEMENTS  \\n \\n10212 Remote Control  \\n \\nThe interruptors at the various switching stations as well as the feeder circuit breakers (and other \\nswitch gear owned and operated by the Railway) at the traction sub -stations are controlled from a \\nRemote Control Centre (RCC) manned throughout the 24 hours of the day. During each shift there \\nis one or more number of Traction Power Controllers (TPC), depending upon t he work load. All \\nswitching operations on the system are thus under the control of one single person, namely TPC, \\nwho is responsible for maintaining continuity of power supply on all sections of the OHE. He also \\nmaintains continuous and close liaison with the Section Controllers in regard to train operations on \\nelectrified sections.  \\n \\nFurther details regarding Remote Control are given in Vol. II of this manual.  \\n \\n10213 Communication Facilities  \\n \\nAll aerial telecommunication lines running by the side of the tracks are replaced with under -ground \\ncables/ microwave to overcome the interference caused by 25 kV single phase ac traction. The \\ncables contain adequate number of pairs of conductors for the various types of Railway \\ntelecommunication circuits on ac tract ion. For technical details reference may be made to Indian \\nRailways Telecommunication Manual.  \\n \\nIn an electrified section it is essential, in the interest of efficiency, to provide several independent \\ntelephone circuits to facilitate quick communication an d to achieve necessary co -ordination between \\ndifferent branches of the Railway. In an emergency several alternative telephone channels will be \\navailable for communication should any one fail. The various telephone circuits provided in \\nelectrified sections are described below briefly : -  \\n \\n1.   Train Control/Section Control :  \\n \\nThis circuit is operated by the Section Controller and is used mainly for controlling train movements \\nwithin his jurisdiction. It has connections with Signal Cabins, ASMs Offices, Loco Sheds and Yard \\nMasters\\' Offices.  \\n \\n2.Dy. Control Telephone  \\n \\nThis circuit is operated by the Deputy Controller and is used for directing traffic operations in \\ngeneral. It has connections with the important Station Masters\\' offices, Yard Masters\\' Offices, L oco \\nSheds and Signal Cabins.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1     (18) 3.   Stock Control Telephone:  \\nThis circuit is operated by the Stock Controller and is mainly used for keeping a continuous watch \\nand to maintain control over the movement s of wagons. It has connections with Yard Masters and \\nimportant Station Masters\\' offices.  \\n \\n4.Traction Loco Control :  \\nThis is a circuit provided for ac traction and is operated by the Traction Loco Controller who is \\nresponsible for movements of electric lo comotives and Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) stock. It has \\nconnections with Electric Loco Sheds, EMU Sheds, important Station Masters, Yard Masters, \\nDivisional Officers such as Sr. DEE/DEE, AEE (RS), Sr DEE/DEE/AEE - (OP), Traffic Control \\nOffices, Traction Fo reman and important crew booking points.  \\n \\n5.Traction Power Control:  \\nThis is a special circuit on ac traction and is used by TPC for all communications in connection with \\npower supply, switching operations and ‘permit -to-work\\'. It has connections with Sta tion Masters\\' \\noffices, cabins, Traction sub - stations, feeding posts, sectioning and sub -sectioning posts, traction \\nmaintenance depots, important Signal Cabins, Divisional Officers such as Sr. DEE (TrD), Sr. \\nDEE/OP and Traffic Control Offices.  \\n \\n6. Emergen cy Control Circuit  \\nThis circuit is provided to facilitate the traction maintenance gangs and electric train crew to get in \\ntouch with TPC with the least possible delay in emergencies. It is also used by train crew in times of \\naccidents for communication w ith the Control Office. This circuit is operated by TPC and is  located \\nin the RCC.  \\n \\nEmergency telephone socket boxes are provided along the track at an interval of 0.75 to 1 km and \\nalso near the signal cabins, sub -sectioning and sectioning posts, insulate d overlaps and feeding \\nposts etc. Portable emergency telephones are given to maintenance gangs, train crew and Station \\nMasters. By plugging the portable telephone into an emergency socket it is  possible to communicate \\nwith the TPC.  \\n \\n7. Hot Line Communicat ion:  \\nHot line communication circuit should be provided between the HQ, divisional HQ traction loco \\ncontroller and electric loco sheds. These would be provided in the HQ with CEE, CEE/Loco, Dy. \\nCEE/RS, Sr. DEE/RS in the sheds and Sr. DEE/OP in the division s.  \\n \\n8. Walkie Talkie sets  \\nEvery maintenance depot of OHE should have adequate numbers of walkie -talkie sets to be \\navailable with them during their normal maintenance work as well as break -downs so that not only \\neffective communication is available at sit e but also to increase the efficiency and productivity of the \\nwork during power blocks. These walkie -talkie sets are to be used primarily for the following \\npurposes:  \\n \\na) To communicate to the maintenance/breakdown gangs/parties that power block has been \\nsanctioned;  \\n \\nb)  To direct and supervise work during the period power block is in force;  \\n \\nc) Confirmation regarding cancellation of power block by each individual party and cancellation of \\npower block.  \\n \\n9. Other Communication Facilities:  \\nAn independent inter-communication    \\'circuit is also provided between the various Section \\nControllers and the Chief Controller for local communication between themselves. Facilities are also \\nprovided for the Chief Controller  \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME   I     (19)  to talk to any station on train control, deputy control, stock control and traction loco control circuits.  \\nSimilarly, facilities are provided to TPC to talk to any station on the train control and traction loco \\ncontrol in an emergency.  Howe ver, it will not be possible for the Chief Controller or TPC to ring \\nindependently any station on any control circuit as this ringing facility is only provided to the \\nrespective Controllers.  \\n \\nIV OVERHEAD EQUIPMENT  \\n \\n10214  Catenary and Contact wire  \\n \\n1. The ove rhead equipment above the tracks comprises of the following: - \\n \\na)  A standard cadmium copper wire of about 65 mm2 section or standard aluminium alloy wire of \\nabout 116 mm 2 section for catenary.  \\n \\nb)  A grooved hard drawn copper contact wire of 107 mm 2 cross-section (when new) supported \\nfrom the catenary by means of droppers of 5 mm diameter spaced not more than 9 m apart.  \\n \\n2. The catenary and contact wire together have an equivalent copper section of 157 mm 2.  The \\ncurrent normally permissible on a single tr ack is 600 A approximately, because of equivalent \\ncross -sectional area of OHE.  This current limit is based on the temperature limit of 850 C in \\ncontact wire.  Certain sections in Waltair -Kirandul section have the catenary and contact wires \\ntogether having  an equivalent copper section of 200 mm 2. \\n \\n3. For loop lines, sidings, yards and spur lines excluding the main running lines and first loop or \\nlines taking off from main running line, tramway type OHE having only grooved hard drawn \\ncopper contact wire of 107  mm2 section is provided.  \\n \\n10215 Height  of Contact wire  \\nThe normal height of contact wire for regulated OHE is 5.60 m (with 10 cm presag for 72 m span) \\nabove rail level.  For unregulated OHE in areas with a temperature range of 40 C to 65 0 C, this \\nfigure is 5.75 m and in areas with a temperature range of 15 0 C to 650 C, it is 5.65 m.  In certain \\ncases, such as under over -line structures, the height may be as low as 4.65 m on BG and 4.02 m on \\nMG.  For passing oversize consignments on such lines, special precautions have to be taken.  \\n \\n10216  Span of Supporting Mast/Structures  \\nThe span normally used for supporting the OHE from masts/structures using the cantilever type \\nbracket assembly varies from maximum 72 m on straight track to 27 m on curved track, the spans \\ndepending upon the degree  of curvature.  The catenary system is normally supported on straight \\ntracks at maximum intervals of 72 m ( 63 m on MG) by cantilever type arms fixed to galvanized \\nbroad flange or I section steel masts or fabricated steel st ructures.  On curves the catenary is \\nsupported at closer intervals, the spans adopted depending upon the degree of curvature.  \\n \\n10217  Stagger  \\nThe contact wire is staggered so that as the pantograph glides along, the contact wire sweeps \\nacross the current c ollecting strips of the pantograph upto a distance of 200 mm on either side of \\nthe centre line on straight runs and 300 mm on one side on curves.  This ensures a uniform wear of \\nthe current collecting strips of the pantographs.  \\n10218  Overlaps  \\nThe OHE cond uctors are terminated at intervals of about 1.5 Km with an overlap generally as \\nshown in Fig. 2.02, the conductor height being so adjusted that the pantograph glides from one \\nconductor to the other smoothly.  \\nThere are two types of overlap spans as under : - \\na) Uninsulated overlap spans where the distance of separation between two contact wires is 200 \\nmm and   \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME I       [20]  \\nthe two conductors are permanently connected together electrically by suitable jumpers.  \\nb) Insulated overlaps, where the two OHE systems are kept apart at a distance of 500 mm. \\nNormally the electrical discontinuity at insulated overlaps is bri dged by interrupters or isolator \\nexcept at neutral sections.  \\n10219  Regulated and Unregulated OHE  \\nOHE with automatic tensioning called \\'regulated OHE\\' is generally provided for all main lines, but for \\nlarge isolated yard and unimportant lines, automatic ten sioning is dispensed with in the interest of \\neconomy and only unregulated OHE is used.  \\n10220  Section Insulator Assembly  \\nSection insulators are provided to insulate the OHE of one elementary section from the OHE of the \\nadjacent elementary section such as at cross -overs.  \\nWhen the pantograph of a locomotive passes from one track to another along a cross -\\nover/turnout, current collection changes from one OHE to other and therefore the runners of the \\nsection insulators overlap with contact wire so that there is no arcing.  \\nOn double line sections with runners trailing, the section insulator assembly using porcelain insulators \\nare fit for speeds upto 120 km/h provided it is installed between the first one -tenth and one - third of \\nthe span. In case the runners of the section insulator assembly are in the facing direction cr it is not \\ninstalled within the first one third of the span, t he speed should be restricted to 80 km/h.  \\n10221  Mechanical Independence of OHE Track - Structures  \\nBy providing independent structures for supporting the OHE of each track, complete mechanical \\nindependence of each OHE is secured. Any irregularity or damage or maladjustment of the OHE of \\none track will not, therefore, affect the performance of the other.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS — AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1    [21] 10222  Flexible Head -Span and Rigid Portals.  \\n \\n \\nIn large yards, where diffi culty is experienced in locating individual supporting structures between \\nthe tracks, a cross catenary wire system called flexible head -span is provided to maintain two or \\nmore catenaries and their contact wires at the appropriate heights and locations. Wh ere the OHE \\nhas to be regulated, rigid portal structures are used.  \\n \\n10223 Maximum Speed  \\n \\nThe OHE with maximum span of 72 m and with presag of that span of 10 mm and with tension of \\n1000 kgf in contact and catenary wire is designed for a speed potential o f up to 160 km/h. The \\nexisting system is  generally fit for 140 km/h with AM -12 pantographs now in use on ac locomotives.  \\n \\nV. SPECIAL WARNING SIGNALS  \\n10224 Signal Marking the end of Catenary  \\n \\nCertain loops and sidings at a station may not be wired. An ele ctric locomotive should not be taken \\ninto an unwired track as its pantographs and the OHE may get damaged and it will require a diesel \\nor steam engine to pull the electric locomotive out of the unwired track. Caution boards as per Fig. \\n2.03 are provided fo r warning the Drivers of the unwired tracks taking off from wired tracks. In \\naddition special indication boards are provided where the OHE ends on a track. Point levers \\ncontrolling the movement of trains from the wired track to the unwired track are fitted  with warning \\ntablets (Boards) as per Fig. 2.04 painted yellow, to warn the cabinman not to admit electric \\nlocomotives on the unwired track.  \\n \\n10225 Warning Signals for Neutral Sections   \\n \\nTo indicate to the Driver that he is approaching a neutral section a nd should be in readiness to open \\nDJ, two warning boards as per Figs. 2.07 & 2.08 are fixed 500 m and 250 m ahead of the neutral \\nsection. The point where DJ is to be opened is indicated by a signal shown in Fig. 2. 05. Indication \\nthat the neutral section h as been passed and DJ may be switched on again is given by another \\nsignal shown in Fig.2.06.  \\n \\n10226 Temporary Signals  \\n \\nOccasionally it becomes necessary to lower the pantograph on certain sections when OHE is not \\nproperly adjusted so as to avoid damage t o the pantographs. In such cases temporary warning \\nboards as shown in Fig. 2.09 are placed ahead of the section, facing the direction from which \\nlocomotives normally approach for this purpose. On reaching such a warning board, the Driver shall \\nopen DJ and lower pantograph/s of his electric locomotive/s. He may raise the pantographs after \\npassing the section and reaching the signal provided for the purpose as per Fig. 2. 10.  \\n \\nAfter a break -down on OHE normally only temporary repairs permitting electric loco motives to pass \\nwith their pantographs lowered are carried out in attending to break -downs, so that the traffic may \\nnot be dislocated unduly. Permanent repairs are done as soon as possible thereafter by taking a \\nprearranged block in consultation with the O perating Department.  \\n \\n10227 Special features of Traction Installations in Waltair - Kirandul section of S. E. Railway  \\n \\nWaltair -Kirandul section of South Eastern Railway is about 471 km long , having large number of \\ntunnels and gradients as high as 1 in 60 and sharp curves of 8 degree . The configuration of traction \\ndistribution system in the section is as under: -  \\n \\ni) OHE - About 329 km of the section has got 19/2.10 mm HDBC catenary and 150 mm2 contact \\nwire. The tension in catenary is 800 kgf while cont act wire has got 1200 kgf tension.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1     (22)   \\n  \\n CHAPTER  III \\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ELECTRIC ROLLING STOCK \\n \\n10300 Classification of Electric Rolling Stock  \\n \\nLocomotives and Multiple Unit stocks are classified by means of a three/four letter code followed by \\na number to indicate the individual class and a series of the same.  \\n \\nThe code letters used for ac locos and EMUs are given below : \\n The first letter denotes the Gauge: \\'W\\' for BG and \\'Y\\' for MG.   \\n \\nThe second (middle) letters \\'A\\' denotes the system of power supply for which it is suitable - A for ac & C for dc, CA for dc & ac.   \\nThe third letter for locos indicates the class of service -  \\n \\'M\\' for Mixed traffic locos suitable for both passenger and freight services,   \\'G\\' for Freight (Goods) service locos,   \\'P\\' for Passenger services locos, and   \\'S\\' for Shunting locos.  \\n \\nMultiple Unit Stock is denoted by  the letter \\'U\\'  \\n \\nThe various classes of ac locos and EMUs at present in service on Indian Railway are as under:-  \\n \\n \\na)   ac Locos-         WAG1, WAG2, WAG3, WAG4, WAG5, WAG6, WAG7, WAP1, WAP2, WAP3,  \\nWAM1, WAM2, WAM3,WAM4, YAM1.  \\n \\nb)   ac/dc Locos-    WCAM1.  \\nc) ac EMUs-              WAU1, WAU2, WAU3, WAU4, YAU.  \\n  \\nIn addition two types of BG dc EMUs converted for ac working are in use on the Eastern Railway.  \\n Salient particulars of each type of ac and ac/dc el ectric locomotive are given in Table No. 3.01 & \\n3.02.  \\n \\nA set of plates containing coloured photographs of  each type of ac/dc Electric Locomotives along \\nwith salient features are annexed with this chapter as a pull-out.   \\nSalient particulars of each type of ac EMU are given in Table No. 3.03.  \\n \\nA set of plates containing coloured photographs of each type of ac EMUs alongwith salient features \\nare attached with  this chapter as a pull-out.   \\n \\n \\n INDIAN RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME      (25)  10301 Important Equipment of Electric Loco/ EMU \\n  \\n1 Pantograph  \\n \\n1.1  For collecting power from 25 kV ac contact wire pantographs are mounted on the roof of the \\ntraction vehicles. AM12 pantograph of Faively design has been adopted by Indian Railways for 25 kV ac electric locomotives and EMUs. These pantographs are provided with steel strips for current collection. The raising and lowering of the pantograph is by means of a pneumatically operated \\nservo motor. This pantograph is a single pan design having two o-springs mounted on it. For keeping the pantograph in the lowered condition, main springs have been used. The suspension of \\npan is on plungers.  \\n \\nThis pantograph is  suitable for operation upto 140 km/h. For increasing the speed potential, \\nimproved pantograph with lower dynamic mass and independent pan heads have been used. Further, in order to improve the life of the contact wire, use of carbon strips has also been tried. Use of carbon strips for current collection has already been adopted in European countries.  \\n \\n1.2 Use of carbon strips necessitates change in the design of the pantograph .The pan head which \\nis more or less rigid in case of steel strip pantograph needs to be made more flexible in the vertical, \\nhorizontal and transverse movement for carbon strip pantographs. This is achieved by improved \\nsuspension of the pan head. The speed potential of such a pantograph is of the order of 250 km/h.  \\n \\nThe pantograph of this design have been imported from M/s Stemman, West Germany for WAG6A, \\nfrom M/s SMC, Australia and M/s ETK, Austria for WAP1 and WAP3 locomotives.  \\n 2.  Circuit Breaker  \\n \\n2.1 Since Inception of 25 kV ac traction system , Air Blast Circuit Breakers manufactured by M/s \\nBrown Boveri-Corporation were used on electric locomotives as well as on EMUs, and are still in \\nuse for about 30 years. These breakers are designed for isolation of power to the traction vehicle in \\nthe event of faults. The Air Blast Circuit Breaker needs great amount of maintenance due to inherent \\nfeatures like large number of parts (735 nos.), complex control block and extinguishing of arc during \\nbreaking of current in air. The life of the main contact on this account is also limited. This breaker also requires substantial amount of dry air for each switching operation.   2.2  Vacuum Circuit Breakers were introduced on el ectric locomotives on Indian Rlys. in the year \\n1985. The VCB is a simplified design with fewer number of parts (260 Nos.), have a simplified \\ncontrol block and self - contained interrupting medium , that is vacuum. Due to these features, the \\nlife of the main contact achievable is as high as 1 lakh electrical operations as against 20,000 \\noperations for air blast circuit breakers. As a result, the periodicity of replacement of main contact is \\nsecond POH for VCB and IOH for Air Blast Circuit Breakers. Besides, these factors, VCB also offers \\nthe advantages of reduced size, reduced weight and reduced maintenance cost as compared to \\nthese for air blast circuit breakers. The total trip-t ime for VCB is less than 60 milli-seconds while the \\nsame is of the order of 100 milli-seconds for air blas t circuit breakers. The air blast circuit breaker is \\nonly capable of breaking the fault current with breaking capacity of 250 MVA. The VCB, besides \\nhaving breaking capacity is also designed for making capacity of the same rating, i.e. 250 MVA and can handle the same level of fault current during closing also. .  \\n  \\nThese circuit breakers (VCBs) were initially imported from M/s. GEC, U.K. and are presently being \\nmanufactured indigenously by GEC, Allahabad. The use of these breakers has been extended to \\nEMUs also.  \\n \\n3.    Transformer  \\n \\n3.1 Power to the traction vehicles is available at 25 kV ac single phase from the contact wire. In \\norder to step down the voltage as well as to control the same for feeding to the traction motors, the \\ntraction power transformers are provided on the traction vehicles.  \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME – I    (26)  1.2 These transformers generally have a primary winding , a regulating winding, traction secondary \\nwindings and auxiliary windings. The regulatin g winding is designed for choosing appropriate \\nvoltage for the traction motors. The auxiliary winding is required for feeding the auxiliary motors on the locomotive.  \\n  \\n3.3 In order to increase the h.p. Of the locomotives, the traction transformers have been uprated \\nfrom time to time keeping the overall dimens ions unchanged on account of space constraint. The \\nupratings have been achieved by  using increased copper section of the conductor used, improved \\ninsulation scheme and in certain cases adoption of aluminium foil wound construction for minimising the losses.   \\n3.4 The original imported transformer used in WAGI locomotives had a capacity of 3000 kVA which \\nwas increased to 3460 kVA for WAG4, 3900 kVA for WAG-5/WAP1 and has been now further increased to 5400kVA for WAG-7 locomotives.  \\n \\n3.5 With the introduction of thyristorised conver tors, the design of the traction transformer has \\nundergone simplification with the deletion of regulat ing winding. The transformer for thyristorised \\nconvertor becomes a two limb construction and traction secondary winding split into 4 windings for two step sequence control.   \\n3.6 The traction transformer necessa rily has to have forced oil circulation and forced air cooling. For \\nthis purose oil pump, oil cooler and blower form an integral part of the traction transformer.  \\n \\n4. Tap Changer   \\n4.1  On load tap changer Type No. 32 of M/s. Brown - Boveri Corporation has been used on most of the 25 kV ac electric locomotives. This type of Tap changer is provided on 25 kV (HT) regulating \\nwinding of locomotive transformer for controlling the voltage input to main transformer. The Tap \\nChanger operates with the help of elaborate mec hanism using an air driven Servo Motor (SMGR) \\nand a bevel gear arrangement. Through precision adjus tment and provision of transition resistance \\n(RGR) it is ensured that there is no break of load current in-side the selector (GR) which is  oil filled \\nand the load current is broken by load switches known as CGR1, CGR2 and CGR3.   \\n4.2 The on load tap changer presently used on electric locomotives for speed control requires great deal of maintenance on account of its inherent des ign and construction. Problems of flash over \\ninside the selector and breakage of various components in SMGR and other sub-assemblies are \\nsome factors affecting to reliability of the locomo tives. The development of thyristor convertors for \\ncontrolling the voltage input to traction motors was therefore undertaken for replacing the existing tap changer and silicon diode rectifier unit.   \\n4.3 The thyristor convertors for electric locomotives offer the advantage of maintenance reduction, \\nsmooth control of speed thereby improving the adhesion and permitting the realisation of higher \\ntractive effort. Thyristorisation of locomotives type WAG1, WAM1, WAM2 and WAM3 is being \\nindigenously done for realising the above benefits.  \\n \\n5.  Traction Motor  \\n \\n5.1 In case of traction motor great emphasis is being given on improving power to weight ratio, \\nkeeping in view the limited space available on locomotive for mounting the same. There is continuous effort to improve the performance of tr action motor by making them lighter/compact, at \\nthe same time more reliable. Indian Railways have been adopting the latest technology available for \\ndesign and manufacture of traction motor. Over a period of years the traction motors have become \\nnow 2.5 times lighter specially for EMU application.   \\n5.2   Improvements in the basic design of traction motor has become possible due to availability of \\nnew insulating materials with high thermal marg ins. Over the years not only new and superior \\nmaterials have been developed but even the basic concepts have undergone radical changes. The \\nmethod of classi-  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME I     (27)  fication of insulating material has also been changed and classification of material, as. generic type \\nor chemical identity is not considered justified. With a view to classify the new insulating material \\ncorrectly additional classifications are added.  \\n \\n5.3 Instead of dealing with individual insulating material, the specification now covers the \\ncombination and system as a whole. The new feature is added because of thermal endurance of the \\nsystem which may not be directly related with thermal capability of individual materials.                                \\n \\n5.4 The procedure for functional evaluation of insulation system also has been laid-down as per IEC 505 to evaluate the typical service life under functional test and the influence of thermal, electrical, mechanical and environmental stresses.   \\n6. Arno Convertor  \\n \\n6.1 Arno Convertor is a special duty machine for conversion of single phase in-coming supply into 3 \\nphase out- put supply. 3 phase supply is essentially required on most of the electrical locomotives for driving certain auxiliary equipment like blowers and compressors. The function of Arno Convertor \\nis to supply 3 phase power required for these auxiliaries.  \\n 6.2 Arno Convertor of ACEC make initially impo rted for WAM-1/WAG-1/ WAG4 were of horizontal \\nconstruction. Indigenously developed Arno Convertor however is of vertical construction. The \\nmachine has mechanical construction suitable to withstand the severe vibrations encountered on locomotives. There was a provision on its top for mounting battery charger generator which has \\nbeen eliminated in present Arno Convertors.  \\n 6.3  The performance of indigenously manufactured Ar no was not up to the level of the performance \\nof ACEC make Arno convertor, however, certain improvements like class \\'F\\' insulation scheme, \\nintegral epoxy moulded terminal box and re vised bearing scheme has led to significant \\nimprovements in reliability and performance of these Arno Convertors.  \\n \\n6.4 As the Arno Convertor offers an inherent voltage unbalanced Indian Railways are making an effort to develop suitable static convertor for taking its place. Static convertors are already available \\nin imported WAG6A locomotive.  \\n \\n7. Motor Compressor Set  \\n 7.1  There are few locomotives equipped with impor ted compressor motor set from M/s. Oerlikon. \\nInitially CLW had used motor compressor set developed and manufactured by M/s. Kirloskar Pnuematic Co. however, M/s. Elgi Equipment Ltd. have developed these motor compressors for \\nelectric locomotives and the same are being used for the last so many years by CLW. Efforts are \\nbeing made by CLW vigorously for development of more sources for supply of compressors. The driving motor for the compressors have been developed indigenously by reputed motor \\nmanufacturer namely M/s. Siemens, M/s. NGEF ,M/s. ABB & M/s. Crompton Greaves Ltd.  \\n 7.2. Indigenously manufactured Air   Compressor is a vertical cylinder air cooled machine. The \\ncompressor is directly driven through an extended crank shaft by an integral direct current motor or \\nalternatively through a flexible coupling by 3 phase induction motor. The compressor is designed to supply compressed air to the associated equipment on 50% duty cycle in normal circumstances. It \\ncan be allowed to run continuously without causing any damage or undue wear.  \\n \\n7.3  The driving motor is high torque 3 phase induction motor designed for direct on line starting. \\nThe earlier motor manufacture and supply were provided with class \\'B\\' insulation scheme. The \\nflexible complete assembly also incorporate the cooling fan for the compressor. With a view to \\nimprove the reliability of 3 phase induction motor certain basic design changes like \\'F\\' insulation, \\nuse of double glass cover conductor winding wire Vacuum pressure impregnation, use of \\nsolventless varnish were adopted. The reliability of  the auxiliary motors have improved considerably \\ndue to these steps.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME I    (28)  \\n  TABLE NO. 3.01 \\n  \\nSalient Data of Mixed/Passenger Electric Locomotives\\n \\n \\n              \\n    \\nSN.

The attention of all railway staff is drawn to the fact that under 25 kV ac 50 Hz single phase \\ntraction, there is heavy induction on all metallic struct ures and conductors in the vicinity of the track. \\nThe induction is two-fold:  \\na)    Electro-static, which results from the high potential of 25 kV on the OHE system.  \\nb)    Electro-magnetic, which is proportional to the currents passing from the sub-station to the OHE \\nto the locomotives / EMUs and back partly th rough the track and partly through the earth.  \\n \\n2. Those who have been used to work on dc traction are liable to overlook taking adequate \\nprecautions required to guard themselves against the dangerous inductive effects of 25 kV ac \\nsystem. Attention is therefore specially dr awn to the need for taking adequate precautions.  \\n \\n3. The voltage induced is quite appreciable on overhead conductors running parallel to the tracks \\ndepending ,on the length of parallelism. This explai ns why most of the overhead telecommunication \\nlines are replaced by underground cables. Special protective measures are required to reduce the \\nadverse effects of induction.   4. In a railway yard, voltage of the order of 200 volts may be induced on yard lighting mains situated \\n8 m away from the centre of a double-line track, if it runs parallel to the 25 kV lines for a distance of \\nabout 270 m., it could be several thousand volts when parallelism is much longer. In such a case, a \\ndangerous voltage due to induction will exist even after power supply to the line has been switched \\noff. No one shall therefore attempt to work on any overhead line running alongside the electrified \\ntracks without taking special precautions of earthing on both sides of the work. Before a section is \\nelectrified, the necessary modifications to distribution lines in all stations and yards should be \\ncarried out, so as to limit the induced voltage within permissible values, but this by no  means \\nobviates the need of earthing the lines on both the sides of the working party. Earthing should be \\ndone individually by each working party as clos e to the work-spot as possible. The distance \\nbetween the two earths shall not exceed 1 km.  \\n \\n5. Such inductive effects occur on large metallic stru ctures such as fencings, structural steelwork of \\nplatforms running parallel to the track. They will therefore have to be earthed suitably to afford \\nsafety.  \\n \\n6. Inductive effects also show themselves on any metallic conductor, such as metallic clothes-lines, \\npowerlines and lines belonging to private parties runni ng parallel and close to the electrified tracks. \\nWide publicity should be given to the effects of induction so that special precautions are taken by \\nthe private parties.  \\n \\nI. WORKING OF STEAM AND DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES IN ELECTRIFIED SECTIONS 10401 Prevention of Smoke Pollution  \\n \\nPollution of OHE insulators due to smoke on account of operation of steam locomotives causes \\nappreciable operating and maintenance difficulties . To reduce pollution to the minimum, the \\nfollowing precautions shall be taken :  \\n1. No steam locomotive should be left standing with the chimney under an OHE insulator. Stabling \\nof steam locomotives with chimneys under  traction structure is prohibited.  \\n \\n2. Continuous blowing of safety valves, sudden opening of blower and priming through exhaust \\nsteam should be avoided as they cause flashover of  insulators resulting in severe consequences. \\nSudden starting of a steam engine shall also be avoided as it may cause slipping of wheels which \\nwould result in priming through exhaust steam, which in turn may cause flashover.   \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME     (34)  10402 Standing on Boiler Shell or Tender  \\n \\nStaff are warned of the danger of standing on the boiler shell or tender when stabled under live OHE \\nas it may result in electrocution.  \\n \\n10403 Working the Fire-Spraying, Advancing of Fuel and Handling of Tools  \\n 1. Special care must be taken while firing coal or raking fire to ensure that the TOOLS DO NOT GET WITHIN THE DANGER ZONE of the OHE.. Spraying of coal with water under electric overhead lines is  forbidden.  \\n \\n2. The firing tools must be handled with great care, and special care should be taken to see that \\nTHESE TOOLS ARE NEVER LIFTED OR RAISED TOWARDS THE OHE. Tools must always be \\nplaced in their respective positions after use.  \\n \\n3. A jet from a hose should never be directed towards the OHE. The jet of water should only be directed horizontally far away from the live OHE and not vertically.  \\n \\n10404 Loading of Fuel  \\n \\n1. The loading of coal or fuelling of the locos shall only be carried out in yards outside the Electrified \\nzones.  \\n \\n2. The height of the coal in the tender must not be more than 4.28 m above the rail level on BG and \\n3.65 m above rail level on MG.  \\n \\n10405 Watering of Steam Locomotives   \\nWhatever may be the height of the contact wire , NO ONE SHOULD CLIMB ON THE TENDER to \\nopen the cover of the water tank or to insert the funnel of the water column. Water columns have \\nbeen suitably modified for operation from ground level.  Only the operating rods provided should be \\nused for this purpose.   \\n10406 Crane Working   \\nNo crane shall be worked on or near tracti on overhead equipment unless an authorised \\nrepresentative of the OHE section is present. When so working, care shall be taken to avoid hitting \\nor damaging OHE structures.  \\n \\n10407 Decorative Fittings  \\n \\nNo decorative or extension pieces be attached to  the chimney of a steam locomotive that would \\nraise its effective height.  \\n \\n10408 Engines Owned by Outside Parties  \\n \\nThe safety precautions mentioned above are equally applicable to locomotives owned by Steel \\nWorks or other factories in the neighborhood of electrical sections that are likely to work in electrified \\nsidings for shunting or other purposes. The special safety rules to be observed in electrified sections should be advised by Sr. DEE (TrD) to parties  owning such locos and their written assurance \\nobtained that their operating staff have been made familiar with these rules.   II. WATERING OF CARRIAGES IN ELECTRIFIED SECTIONS \\n10409 Watering Arrangements - Basic Precautions  \\n \\nWith electrification, \\'side filling\\' arrangement s for coaches have been introduced Asia long term \\nmeasure, in lieu of overhead filling arrangements wh ich necessitate shut down of power for watering \\nand other precautions. Since all carriages have no t yet been provided with side filling arrangement, \\nspecial arrangements have been made for  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME     (35)  Overhead watering of carriages in some electrified stations. The following precautions must be \\nobserved in such interim arrangements:   \\n \\n1.   If the carriages are standing on lines having overhead traction wires, nobody shall get on to the \\nroofs of the carriages unless the overhead traction wires above are made dead and earthed.  \\n \\n2.   Staff getting on to the roofs of the carriages for watering, after the overhead traction wires above \\nsuch carriages are made dead, should be warned agains t carrying long poles or any other articles \\nwhich may come within the danger zone, that is within 2 m of the live traction wires on the adjoining \\nlines. They should also be warned about the risk of extending the water hoses or any part of their \\nbody or directing water jets within the danger zone i.e. Within 2 m of live overhead traction wires.  \\n \\n10410 Watering Section   \\n1. For the purpose of isolation and earthing the OHE, wires  above the watering arrangements for  \\neach platform will form a separate elementary sect ion i.e. different platforms will have different \\nwatering sections. This is to ensure that isolation of each platform can be done independently. The \\nlimits of each watering section shall be marked by danger limit board (Fig. 4. 0 1) hanging from the \\ncatenary at either end. These constitute the limits within which, alone watering of the carriages may be done. In Fig. 4.02 CD is the watering section.  \\n \\nSeparate interruptors or isolators shall be provid ed for controlling supply to each watering section. \\nKeys for such interruptors/isolators shall be provided with metal tags on which the numbers of the \\ninterruptors/isolators are punched.  \\n \\n2. A neutral section about 12 m long bounded by section insulators is provided at -, either end of \\neach watering section. The purpose of the neutral section is to afford additional protection to the watering section against approach of any electric lo comotive or any other type of \"feeding in\" from \\nthe live sections on either end. In Fig. 4.02, BC and DE are the neutral sections.   \\n10411 Controlling Switches  \\n \\n1 . \\'L\\' is the locally operated interruptor/isolator at the end of the platform in  a separate enclosure.  \\nThe Key for the enclosure is with the ASM on duty.  \\n \\n \\n2. S 1 and S 2 are manually operated isolators - one at each end of the watering section, the \\npurpose being to switch off power from the respec tive small neutral sections and to earth the two \\nends of the watering section. For this purpose the two isolators are provided with earthing heels.   \\n3. Elernentary sections AB and EF are normally live.  \\n \\n4. A feeder line for maintaining continuity (shown dotted in Fig 4.02) is carried on the OHE structure \\nhaving supermasts.  \\n \\n10412 Sequence of Interlocking and Operation  \\nThe following are the interlocking arrangements and the sequence of operations:-  \\n 1. The enclosure to interruptor/isolator \\'L\\' is locked and its key is with the ASM on duty. When \\nrequired, the ASM issues it to the lineman, only  against a receipt on the register kept for the \\npurpose.  \\n \\n2. If an interruptor is provided, on its frame is mounted the opening key which is accessible only \\nafter the enclosure to the interruptor is opened. This ensures that no one can open the interruptor, without taking the key of the lock of the enclosure  from the ASM. The tripping key is normally back \\nlocked in the lock on the interruptor frame. It can be extracted from the lock only after the interruptor \\nis opened to switch off supply to the watering section. Similarly, when an isolator is provided it can be opened only by the linesman on receipt  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 1     (36)     \\nBRASS  BADGES FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS FIG. 4.03  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME     (37)  \\nof its key from the ASM on duty. For opening the (main) isolator \\'L\\' the additional precautions detailed in the \\nChapter VI of Vol. 11 of this Manual shall be observed.   \\n3. Each of the isolators \\'S1\\' and \\'S2\\' is provided with a double lock. The opening key extracted as above from \\ninterruptor\\'L\\'when inserted in S1 and turned, releases the operating handle of S1. If the isolator S1 is now \\nopened or closed, a key K 1 (normally back-locked in the double lock on S 1) is released, simultaneously \\nlocking the operating handle as well as the opening key. This ensures that once the key KI is in the hands of \\nthe operator, the interruptor \\'L\\'as well as isolator S1 cannot be operated. The key Kl as obtained now is known \\nas the isolator Interlocked key.     \\n4. Key K1 is taken to the other end of the platform and inserted into the double lock of S2. This releases the \\noperating handle of S2 and if isolator S2 is now opened another key K2 normally back-locked in lock of S2 is \\nreleased. This key is handed over to the TXR in charge by the authorised person as an assurance that the \\nsupply to the watering section is cut-off and made dead and earthed. Key K2 is known as the \"permit-to-work\" \\nkey.  \\n \\n5. The details given above and in subsequent paras are mainly for watering sections controlled by \\ninterruptors. The same principles however apply for watering sections controlled by manually operated \\nisolating switches, though the details vary somewhat between installations at different stations.  \\n \\n10413 Persons Authorised to Open Interruptors and Isolator Switches  \\n \\nNo staff of rank lower than a linesman working under the Traction Foreman (OHE) is authorised to open or \\nclose the interruptors or isolators controlling power supply to the overhead traction wires in the watering section.,   A list of names of the authorized linesmen duly si gned by the Traction Foreman (OHE) shall be exhibited \\nprominently in the office of the ASM and the TXR of the station concerned. Each such linesman should also \\ncarry an identity card with photograph or specimen signature.  \\n \\nIt will be the duty of the linesman concerned to report to the ASM on duty at least half an hour before the \\nscheduled arrival of a train. No linesman on duty sh all leave his place of duty until he has been properly \\nrelieved by his reliever and that too after his reliever has been introduced by him to the ASM on duty at the time.  \\n \\n10414 Custody of Keys   1. The keys of the interruptor enclosures and isolators shall be inscribed with the distinguishing marks and locked in glass-fronted Key box and kept in the personal custody of the ASM on duty. The keys should never \\nbe kept in a bunch, but hung on individual pegs provided for each. The description of each key shall be \\npainted above each peg to avoid confusion.   \\n2. When the watering section of a particular platform is required to be made dead and earthed for watering of carriages, the ASM on duty shall give the key of the lock of the enclosure of the cont rolling lnterruptor/ isolator \\nof the platform to the linesman on duty and getting his acknowledgment in a \"Key Register\" to be provided for \\nthe purpose at the station. This key shall be handed over immediately on arrival of the passenger train \\nconcerned, if hauled by an electric loco. If, however, the train, the carriages of which are to be watered, is not hauled by an electric locomotive, the key may be handed over to the linesman even prior to the arrival of the \\ntrain, in question so as to save time, provided the earlier isolation of the watering section does not interfere \\nwith the movement of the other train. (It is to be unders tood that the handing over of the key of the interruptor \\nenclosure to the linesman amounts to the requisition for a power block).  \\n \\n3. The ASM shall ensure that no electric locomotive with raised pantograph is allowed to enter a watering \\nsection till the watering linesman returns the key back to the ASM and signs in the Key Register.   \\n10415 Watering of Carriages  \\nOn receipt of the \"permit-to-work\" key of the concerned  watering section, the TXR-in-charge of watering shall \\npersonally check that the key received by him bears the correct number and relates to the concerned.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANU AL \\\\/OLUME 1      (38)  watering section on which the carriages to be watered are standing. The TXR-in-charge shall also \\nensure that the train is standing within the limit of the watering section bounded by the danger limit \\nboards on the overhead traction wires. He will then arrange to fix yellow flags (or yellow lights by \\nnight) on either end of the train high enough to be visible from the carriage roof. He will  at the same \\ntime hand over to each of his men who are to go up on the roof of the carriages, a number badge of \\nthe legend and description shown in Fig. 4.03 as the authority to go on the carriage roof for the \\nwatering.  \\n \\nOnly the staff holding the badges mentioned above are authorised to go to the roof of the carriages \\nand water the same. The badges when not in use, shall be kept in the personal custody of the TXR- \\nin-charge of watering under lock and key. Any loss of the badge shall be notified immediately and \\nthe badge cancelled.     \\nThe TXR shall ensure that his staff deputed for watering are conversant with the following \\nprecautions:   \\n1. Watering operation shall be confined to the limi ts specifically marked by \"Danger Limit Boards\" \\nhanging from the catenary wire of the OHE above the concerned watering section.  \\n \\n \\n2. The hydrants shall not be opened till the other end of the hose pipe has been inserted in the \\noverhead tank of the carriage.  \\n \\n3. The hose pipes shall not be withdrawn from such  overhead tank, till the hydrant has been closed.  \\n \\nPrecautions 2  and 3 above are necessary to avoid accidental contact of a water jet with the live  \\noverhead traction wires of  the adjacent tracks.  \\n \\nEach platform adjoining the watering section shall have a small area marked with the legend \\n\"Watering Gang\". Each of the staff deputed for watering shall be instructed to assemble in this area as soon as watering is completed or they are signalled to stop watering and get down from the roof \\nof the carriages.  \\n \\nOn completion of the watering, the TXR-in-charge of watering shall collect the authority badges \\ngiven to his men and ensure that all the badges have been returned and there are no men on the \\ntop of the carriages in the watering section. The TXR shall also ensure that no material has been left \\non the carriage roof and that all the watering hoses have been brought down and the watering \\nhydrants closed.   \\n10416 Restoration of Supply   \\nOn receipt of the permit-to-work key the linemen on duty shall proceed to restore supply as under:-  \\n \\nHe shall insert the \"permit-to-work key\" in the double lock of the isolator switch S2 and turn the \\nsame. This will release the isolator switch handle which shall then be operated to close the isolator. \\nAfter this operation the isolator interlock key shall be extracted from the double lock and taken to \\nisolator Sl and inserted in its double lock and turned. This will release the operating handle of isolator S1 which shall then be closed, thus back-locking the Isolator interlock key. The interruptor \\nopening key may then be taken out and inserted in the key hole of the interruptor lock and turned \\nafter which operation the interruptor should be closed. The interruptor enclosure shall then be closed and locked and the key returned to the ASM on duty. The returning of the key to the ASM on \\nduty signifies that the power block has been cancelled. The linesman on duty returning the key shall \\nsign the Key Register entering the time at which the key is returned. The ASM on duty shall also sign the register in acknowledgment of having got the key back.  \\n \\nOn receipt of the key the ASM shall arrange to start the train.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME      (39)  10417 Key Register  \\n \\nEach watering station shall have a key register for recording the interchange of keys between the \\nASM on duty and the linesman. This key register will have the following columns:   \\n1.  Date  \\n \\n2.   Description of  the key  \\n 3.   Watering Section No.   \\n 4.    Train No.   5.     Time made over  \\n \\n6.     Signature of the linesman  \\n \\n7.     Time returnd  \\n \\n8.      Signature of the linesman   9.      Brief reasons for delay if any.  \\n \\n \\n10. Signature of ASM on duty.  \\n \\nSafety depends essentially on the proper exchange of the keys and correct record of the same. All \\nexchange of keys shall take place directly  between the persons concerned and not through \\nmessengers. The custody of any key shall be the responsibility of the person possessing the same \\nat the time.  \\n 10418 Loss of Key   In case of loss or damage to any key controlling the switching arrangements to the watering section, the same should be reported at once to the TPC over phone and by XXR message addressed to the \\nSr. DEE(TrD), Sr. DOM and Chief Controller of the Division. The Sr. DEE(TRD) shall make \\nimmediate arrangements for the provision of a new lo cking system requiring a different set of keys.  \\n During such period the TXR-in-charge of the wate ring shall personally be responsible for making \\ndead and earthing the overhead traction wires of the watering section concerned. He shall arrange to lock the operating handles of the interruptor\\'L\\' and isolator switches S 1 and S2 by his own \\npadlocks, the keys of which shall be in his personal custody-till the watering is completed and the \\nbrass badges authorizing his staff to go on the top of the carriages for watering are returned to him.   \\nIII. LOADING AND UNLOADING OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS \\nII. 10419 Precautions to be Observed \\n \\nIn order to avoid any sparking during loading or unloading of petroleum products at the petroleum \\nsiding, electrical continuity must be main tained between the earth systems of petroleum \\ninstallations, the track and electric overhead traction installation.  The loading zone should be insulated from the rest of the railway net work during loading and unloading operations.  The \\nfollowing precautions / arrangements would be necessary. \\n \\nArrangements \\n1. Provision of an equipotential link between the earth system of petroleum siding installations and \\nthe track via a switch. \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME  I     (40) 2. Setting up of neutral zones (insulating joints) in  the track to avoid any risk of propagating stray \\ncurrent. \\n \\n3. Setting up neutral zones/ sections in the contact and catenary wires similar to loco inspection \\npits. \\n \\n4. Provision of longitudinal bonds on both the rails as well as transverse bond ( 30 m intervals) on \\nthe track.  All masts and metallic structures in the vicinity of the track/siding should be provided \\nwith structure bond. \\n 5. Provision of  10 Ohm earths connected to the petroleum siding on each side at the insulated \\njoint. \\n \\nPrecautions \\n1. No oil tanker is permitted to stable under live OHE for inspection purpose. \\n \\n2. Fueling to be done by side filling arrangements only. \\n \\n3. Pipelines in the vicinity of the track should be properly earthed.  4. Minimum 2 m electrical clearance from live OHE of the adjacent track or any other equipment \\nnearby must be maintained.  \\n \\n5. During service operations, the continuity of track and the contact wire should be set up at the \\nsame time the link between the track and petroleum facility should be opened.  \\n \\n6. The isolators at the neutral section of OHE should be kept open, OHE made dead and earthed. \\n \\nIV RULES APPLICABLE TO PERMANENT WAY STAFF \\n10420  General  These instructions have already been included in the supplement to Part ‘J’ of Chapter II of the \\nIndian Railways Permanent Way Manual. \\n \\nThese instructions lay down precautionary measur es to be observed by railway personnel working \\nin the vicinity of the tracks equipped with 25 Kv  ac OHE.  These have already been included in the \\nsupplement to Para ‘J’ of Chapter II of the Indian Railway Permanent Way Manual which are reproduced below:- \\n \\n10421  Need for Precautions \\nPrecautions are required to be taken on account of the following : \\na) Proximity of a live conductor: The risk of direct contact with live OHE is ever present while \\nworking in electrified sections such as for pain ting of steel work of through spans of bridges and \\nplatform covered sheds. \\n \\nb) Build up of potential due to return current in rails : The return current in the rails may cause a \\npotential difference.  \\n g) between rail and the surrounding mass of earth; \\n \\nii) between the two ends of a fractured rail ; \\n \\niii) between the two rails at an insulated joint; \\niv) between earth and any other metallic mass.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME1      [41] \\n c) Building up of potential due to induction in metallic bodies situated close the OHE. It is important \\nto note that dangerous voltages may be inducted in metallic masses such as fencing posts in \\nthe vicinity of traction conductors.  To avoid possibility of shock due to such voltages the metallic \\nstructures are bonded together and earthed. \\n \\n10422  General Precautions . \\nThe precautions laid down below must be followed under all circumstances in sections equipped for \\n25 Kv ac single phase, 50 Hz. Traction in addition to  those referred to in Indian Railway Permanent \\nWay Manual.  1. No work shall be done above or within a distance of 2 m from the live OHE without a ‘permit to \\nwork’ \\n2. No part of tree shall be nearer than 4 m from the nearest live conductor.  Any tree or branches \\nlikely to fall on live conductor should be cut or trimmed periodically to maintain this clearance.  \\nCutting or trimming should be done by engineering staff in the presence of authorized staff of \\nthe OHE section. \\n3. No fallen wire or wires shall be touched unless power is switched off and the wire or wires \\nsuitably earthed.  In case the wires drop at a level crossing, the Gate-keeper shall immediately \\nmake arrangements to stop all road traffic and keep the public away. \\n4. As far as possible closed wagons shall be used for material trains.  In case open or hopper \\nwagons are used, loading and unloading of such wagons in electrified tracks shall be done \\nunder the supervision of an Engineering Official not below the rank of a Permanent Way Mistry \\nwho shall personally ensure that no tool of any part of the body of the worker comes within the \\n‘danger zone’ i.e. within 2 m of the OHE. \\n5. Permanent way staff should keep clear of the tracks and avoid contact with the rails either when \\napproaching or reaching the work-spot when an el ectrically hauled train is within 250 m. \\n6. When unloading rails along side the tracks, it should be ensured that rails do not touch each \\nother to form a continuous metallic mass of length greater than 300 m. \\n \\n10423  Continuity of Track \\n During maintenance or renewal of track, continuity  of the rails serving electrified tracks shall \\ninvariably be maintained.  For bridging gaps which may be caused during removal of fish plates or \\nrails, temporarily metallic jumpers of appr oved design shall be provided as under :- \\n \\na. In case of a rail fracture, the two ends of the fractured rail shall be firs t temporarily connected by \\na temporary metallic jumper of approved design (Fig. 4.04). In all cases of discontinuity of rails, \\nthe two parts of the rail shall not be touched with bare hands.  Gloves of approved quality shall \\nbe used. \\nb. In the case of track renewals, temporary connections shall be made as shown in Fig. 4.05. \\nc. In the case of a defective or broken rail bond, a temporary connection shall be made as \\nmentioned in (a) above. \\nd. Before fish plates are loosened or removed,  temporary connections shall be made as in (a) \\nabove. \\n \\n10424  Permanent Way Tools \\n Permanent Way tools alongwith the gloves shall be used in the manner as approved by the Chief Engineer of the Railway.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME I    (42)  \\n \\n FIG 4.05 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n INDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME-I     [43] \\n10425  Track-Circuited Rails. \\n \\nIn track-circuited areas where the rail/s has/have insulated joints, such joints shall not be bridged \\nwith bare hands or any metallic article.  Similarly simultaneous contact with an insulated section of rail/s and non-insulated section of rail/s of the same or other tracks shall be avoided. \\n \\n10426  Care in Handling Pipes etc. \\n \\nUse of rails as a foot path, a seat or for such other purposes is strictly prohibited.   Particular care shall be taken when carrying or handling long pipes, poles, overhanging on the shoulder or otherwise to avoid all possibility of such objects and work pieces coming inadvertently in contact \\nwith or within 2 m of live equipment. \\n \\n10427  Steel Measuring Tapes not to be used . \\n \\nIn  electrified  tracks, steel tape or metallic tape  or tape  with  woven  metal  reinforcement should  \\nnot be used.  \\n \\n10428   Traction  Structure Foundation  \\n 1) The top of  foundation  block of track structures shall  be kept clear of all materials and kept tidy. \\n2) While excavation the foundations not be exposed and there should be no risk of  sinking of the \\nfoundations. \\n                                               V. RULES FOR  S&T INSTALLATIONS  \\n \\n10429 Effect  of 25 KV  ac, 50 Hz, Sing le Phase Traction  on S&T  Equipment  \\n \\n1. Any circuit in the vicinity of 25kv ac OHE is influenced by electrostatic and electromagnetic \\ninduction.  The  electrostatic induction is practi cally eliminated by transferring S&T circuits into \\nunderground cables protected with metal sheath.  The electromagnetic induction causes various \\ncurrents and voltages to develop in conductors parallel to the track.  These include the rails, traction return conductor where provided, cable sheat h, any other conductors in the vicinity and \\nS&T circuits.  The voltages that occur in the conductors appear a potential gradients.  The value \\nof induced voltage depends on various factors such as: \\n \\na) Length of parallelism between the cable conductor and electrified track.  b) Soil conductivity. \\n \\nc) Screening efficiency of cable sheath where existing. \\n \\nd) Return current through the rails and return conductor where provided.  \\ne) Mutual inductance between catenary and cable conductors. \\n \\nf) Current in the OHE. \\nAppropriate precautions to overcome the effects of the induced voltages therefore have to be taken by S&T department.  \\nOther aspects in which S&T equipment is affected are: \\n \\ni) OHE structures and fittings affect visibility of signals to some extent and may come in the \\nway of a signal;  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME1     [44] ii) Restrictions come in the path of traction return currents on section provided with track \\ncircuits. \\n \\n2. Essential precautions to be taken while working on signalling and telecommunication \\ninstallations as described.  Reference may also  be made to Chapter XVII of the Indian Railways \\nTelecommunication Manual. \\n \\n10430  Precautions in the Event of Breakage of Wires. \\nShould a catenary or contact wire snaps and falls on the running track, it is possible that the fault current may damage signalling equipment.  The following precautions shall, therefore, be taken.  \\n1. The Section Controller on receipt of an advice of a break in traction overhead lines shall \\nimmediately advise, by the quickest possible means, the signal maintenance and operating staff \\nof the section where the catenary/contact wires have broken. \\n \\n2. If abnormal working of any equipment is noticed, its working shall be immediately suspended \\nand necessary action under the rules shall be taken. \\n \\n3. On receipt of the intimation from the Section controller the staff  responsible for the maintenance \\nof signaling of the section shall immediately proceed to the site and test all signaling circuits and allied equipment paying particular attention to the outdoor signaling gear to check if any damage \\nhas taken place.  An authorized representative of the Signal Department shall submit a \\ncertificate that everything is working all right and send it to his superiors along with a detailed \\ntest report as soon as possible. \\n \\n10431  Works on Signal Posts and Fittings. \\n \\n1. No staff shall work on any portion of a signal post or its fittings falling within a distance of 2 m \\nfrom a 25 Kv live OHE or a metal part electric ally connected to this OHE unless such portion is \\nprotected with a metallic screen in accordance with approved instructions. \\n 2. If for any reasons the protective metallic screen  is not provided, the staff shall not undertaken \\nany work on those portions of the signal or its fittings falling within  2 m of 25 Kv live OHE, \\nunless power to the 25 Kv live OHE has been switched off and a ‘permit to work’ has been \\nobtained.  To draw the attention of the staff in such cases a red band 10 cm wide shall be \\npainted all around the signal post at a height of 3 m above the rail level. \\n 3. The inspectors of the Signal Department and the Station Masters shall explain these instructions \\nto the staff working under them and ensure that they are correctly understood. \\n \\n10432  Precautions against build up of Potent ial due to Return Current in Rails. \\n 1. The flow of return current in the rails may cause a potential difference to build up between: \\n \\na) two rails at an insulated joint of the track circui t at an ordinary joint in case the fish plates are \\nbroken. \\nb) two ends of a fractured rail; c) an insulated rail and the rail used for the traction return current ; and  d) the rail and the surrounding mass of earth. \\n \\n2. Whenever staff have to work on installations which are in direct contact with the rails, they shall : \\n \\na) use tools of the type approved for the purpose by the Chief Signal and Telecommunication \\nEngineer of the Railways ; and \\nb) observe the provisions of Chapter II of the Indian Railways Permanent Way Manual . \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME1     [45] 10433  Precautions against Induction Potential in Metallic Bodies. \\n \\nVoltage will be induced in signalling and telecommunication circuits when the length of the \\nparallelism to the track is apprec iable, due to normal load currents or short circuit current in the \\nevent of a fault on the traction system.  Dangerous potentials may also develop in circuits with earth \\nconnection if the earth connection gets broken for any reason.  Consequently every time staff have \\nto work on signalling and telecommunication circuits along with 25 Kv ac electrified lines, they shall \\ntake precautions to protect themselves and the equipment as prescribed by the S&T Department. \\n Some of the important precautions are however given below: a) Rubber gloves and tools with insulated handles should be used. \\n \\nb) When the work to be done is of such a nature t hat rubber gloves cannot be used, splitting of the \\ncircuits into sections to reduce the length of parallelism and earthing them to ‘drain out’ the \\nvoltage should be adopted.  Both the steps should be taken simultaneously.  If these protective \\nmeasures cannot be applied, staff must get insula ted from ground by using rubber mats or other \\napproved form of protection.  \\n \\nc) The line wires of the electric block instrum ents are likely to get heavy induced voltages and \\nevery time the staff handles the line wire terminals of the block instruments, they must observe the provisions of paras (a) and (b) above.  Line  wire terminals should be painted red to remind \\nthe maintenance staff of the danger.  The maintenance inspectors shall explain the meaning of \\nthis painting to the maintenance staff and ensure that it is correctly understood by them. \\n d) Before cutting the armour or the lead sheath of a cable or the wires in the cable, an electrical \\nconnection of low ohmic resistance should be est ablished between the two parts of the armour \\nor the sheathing and the wires that are to be separated by cutting. \\nVI  OVER-DIMENSIONED CONSIGNMENTS \\n \\n10434  Definition of Over-Dim ensioned Consignments (ODC ) \\n When a consignment whose length, width and height are such that one or more of these infringe \\nStandard Moving Dimensions at any point during the run from start to destination, then the \\nconsignment is called an Over-dimensioned consignment (ODC).  It is also known as out-of -gauge \\nload. \\n If any consignment exceeds the following dimensions, it is to be treated as ODC or over dimensioned consignment. \\n \\n       BG                MG \\n \\na)  Length      13716 mm  12192 mm  \\nb) Height      \\n i) at centres      2743 mm   2540 mm \\n ii) at corners      2134  mm   2134 mm \\n c) Width       2997 mm   2540 mm   \\nd) Top width                 610 mm    610 mm \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-ACTRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME1     (46) \\n \\n 10435  Classification of ODCs \\n \\nODCs are classified as under: \\n ‘A’ class ODC having clearance (i.e. clearance measured under stationary conditions) as 228.6 mm \\nand above from the fixed structures but infringes the standard moving dimensions. \\n \\n‘B’ class ODC having gross clearance of 152.4 mm \\n ‘C’ class ODC having clearance of less than 152.4 mm but more than 76.2 mm.  \\n10436  Precautions for Movement of ODCs in25 Kv ac Electrified Sections. \\n \\nThe following precautions must be observed for transport of ODCs in the electrified sections: \\n \\n1. Movement of ODC shall undertaken only after sanction of competent authority has been \\nobtained.  \\n \\n2. In all cases where ODC is to be moved, staff accompanying the ODC shall remember that the \\nOHE is ‘live’ except when a power block has been obtained from the traction officials.  Even when a power block has been obtained, all lines other than those for which the power block has \\nbeen granted are to be treated as ‘live’ at 25 Kv. \\n \\n3. The following  are the prescribed clearances fr om contact wire for the passage of ODCs through \\nelectrified sections and the special restrictions required: \\n \\na) Special speed restriction is not requir ed when the gross clearance is more than 390 mm. \\n \\nb) Speed must be restricted to 15 km/h when the clearance is between 390 mm and 340 mm. \\n c) Speed must be restricted to 15 km/h and power to OHE must be switched off when the \\nclearance from the contact wire is less than 340 mm. \\n \\n4. No consignment with less than 100-mm clea rance from the overhead contact wire will be \\npermitted in a 25 KV electrified section. \\n 5. A representative of the OHE section should acco mpany all ODCs  having clearance as specified \\nin items 3(b) and 3(c) of item (3) above, to supervise safe movement of the ODC at locations \\nwhere clearance from the contact wire is critical. \\n6. A representative of the OHE section should also accompany ODCs having width more than \\n1981 mm for BG (and 1910 mm for MG) from centre line of track. \\n7. Section Controller and Traction Power Controller must coordinate while an ODC moves in \\nelectrified section in order to ensure that OHE masts are not damaged at locations where the \\nclearance is critical. \\n8. A list of structures where the clearance are restricted in the electrified section and also the \\nclearance, available under the over-bridges should be with the Section Controller and TPCs. \\n 9. To facilitate checking of clearance from the Contact wire for over-dimensioned consignments, \\nthe Operating and Engineering branches at the Divisional and Headquarter level should have \\nwith them up-to-date charts showing location of the minimum height of contact wire and \\nclearances of OHE structures in the electrifi ed section.  The Operating Department may permit \\nmovement of ODCs on the basis of clearance checked with the help of the above mentioned \\ncharts subject to the speed restrictions.  Howe ver, when sanction of CRS is required to be \\nobtained for movement of any particular  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME1     [47] ODC, a specific reference should be made to CEE and a certificate obtained from him in the \\nfollowing form.  \\n \\nCertified that the minimum height of contact wire on the section over which the consignment is to move is not less than   except at the following locations where restrictions are indicated below \\nshould be observed:- \\n \\nSection     Location  Height of       Power ‘ON’  Speed Restriction  \\n       Contact wire      or ‘OFF’  in km/h       1       2            3        4            5 \\n \\n10437  Power Blocks for Movement of ODC \\n \\nWhen an ODC is permitted to be moved in an electrified section with the OHE power off, it will be \\nthe responsibility of the Section Controller to arrange with the TPC for power to be cut off before \\nadmitting the ODC into the section.  An authorised representative of the Traction Distribution  \\nBranch will obtain confirmation from TPC by mess age supported by private number that power has \\nbeen switched off and then issue a memo to the Guard of other traffic official in charge of the train to the effect that power has been switched off over the specified section.  Only on receipt of such memo may the train carrying the ODC be allowed to enter the section. \\n \\nNote: Since such a memo is not a “permit to work”, earthing of the OHE is not necessary. \\n VII. OTHER PRECAUTIONS \\n \\n10438  Movement of Rubber Tyred Vehicles on Railway Wagons . \\n \\nAll metallic parts of rubber tyred vehicles whic h are transported on railway wagons through 25 KV \\nelectrified areas, shall be earthed to avoid the effect of induction.  10439  Hoarding Boards. \\n \\nHoarding boards provided in the vicinity of electrif ied tracks should be located at a safe distance \\nfrom the track so that the event of their suppo rting structures being damaged during agitation or \\nstorms it should not fall on the OHE or infringe the track.  For this purpose, CCS and CPRO will \\nensure that while granting approval for erection of hoardings boards, it must be ensured that not only these are located at the safe distance from the track but also their structural arrangements are \\nproperly secured. \\n \\nVIII COMPETENCY CERTIFICATE \\n 10440 Competency Certificate and Courses for As sistant Station Masters/Guards of EMUs. \\n \\nAll staff who are required to work in electrified territory must have undergone a course in Electric \\ntraction so that they are made familiar with the wo rking rules in the electrified sections.  ASMs are \\nalso sometimes required to operate isolators at the station premises for which necessary training is \\nto be imparted.  Similarly, the guards of the EMUs are also required to undergo an operational course for the working of EMUs and are to under go a refresher course at regular intervals of 6 \\nmonths at Electrical Training Schools.  Operatin g department will ensure that only that staffs who \\nhave undergone the course in Electric traction are posted in electrified areas.  \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTIO MANUAL-VOLUME 1      [48] \\n CHAPTER  V \\n \\nELECTRICAL ACCIDENTS  \\n Para  No.    Subject  \\n10500    Electrical Accident \\n10501    Electrical Accidents – Action to be taken \\n10502    Observance of Rules \\n10503    Electrical Inspector to Railway 10504    Reporting of Accidents \\n10505    Accident Inquiries \\n10506    Accident Registers and Annual Returns \\n10507    First Aid \\n      RESUSCITATION FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCK \\n \\n10508    Instructions to be Displayed \\n10509    Removal from Contact \\n10510    Artificial Respiration \\n10511    Typical Electrical Accidents. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME 1     [49]  \\n        CHAPTER   V \\n \\n      ELECTRICAL ACCIDENTS  \\n 10500   Electrical Accident \\n \\nAn electrical accident is caused directly or indirect ly due to electrical causes, that is, it includes any \\nelectric shock or electric burn, whether minor , major or fatal and whether suffered by railway \\nservants or others.  \\nA person may suffer electric shock by coming in contact with :- \\n \\n1. Live mains. LT or HT. \\n \\n2. Overhead lines, which although made dead by isolation at both ends still develop high potentials \\non account of electro-static or electro-meganetic  induction due to parallelism with other high \\nvoltage live lines, or due to lightning discharges during thunderstorms: \\n 3. Parts which have become live due to leakage either because of low insulation resistance of the \\nelectrical windings, high earth resistance of discontinuity of the earthing lead to the body: \\n \\n4. Areas which develop  a high potential gradient  such as near an earth electrode through which a \\nfault current is flowing, and is insufficient to blow the fuse or cause the circuit breaker to trip. \\n \\nIn any well-maintained installation, no electrical accidents should occur.  Every accident can, in the \\nfinal  \\nAnalysis, be traced to one or more of the following causes, if properly probed into:- \\n \\n1. Disregard or non-observance of the prescribed rules laid down:  2. Ignorance of rules and insufficient training of staff: \\n \\n3. Carelessness, casual and indifferent methods of working, including improper earthing indicating \\ninadequate supervision: \\n 4. Faulty protective equipment and poor maintenance:  \\n5. Over-confidence or sheer laziness: \\n \\n6. Old habits of working on non-electrified lines: \\n 7. Misunderstanding of instructions: \\n \\n8. Inadvertence. \\n \\nEvery rule prescribed is the result of experience gathered over the years by several persons, and owes its origin to some electrical accident or damage to equipment observed in the past.  Rules and procedures prescribed should therefore, be taken se riously, and never allowed to fall into discuss.  \\nTo enable a better appreciation of the need for me ticulous observance of the safety rules \\nprescribed, brief particulars of several case histories have been presented in para 10511. \\n10501  Electrical Accidents – Action to be taken \\n \\n1. In the event of an electrical accident or the possibility of an accident, the senior most official \\npresent at the site of the accident shall take the following preliminary precautions immediately:- \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL –VOLUME I    [50] a) If there is a breakdown of the overhead lines, he should arrange to cordon off the area, so that no one \\nelse may get injured.  He shall also warn Drivers of trains. \\n \\nb) Arrange to cut off supply to the installation concerned by telephoning to the Traction Power Controller or \\nthe nearest Electrical Department official, and simultaneously arrange for an Authorised person to the spot.  No one may attempt to rescue an electrocuted pe rson untill power supply has been cut off.  \\n \\nb) Send for medical assistance.  In the meanwhile, after the injured person, if any, has been separated from \\nthe electrified lines, he shall arrange to render first aid; artificial respiration should be started immediately \\nif the patient is not breathing. \\n 2. Immediately on arrival at site, the Authorised Electrical Department Official (Foreman/Chargeman), shall \\nfirst check and made sure that the steps mentioned have been correctly taken.  After attending to the \\ninjured and clearing the lines, he shall make a detailed note of all factors relating to the accident, preserve \\nevidence and record the statements of those who were near the accident spot.  He shall also carry out a preliminary investigation as to the possible cause of accident and get full particulars of the injury or \\ndamage suffered and advise the Sr. Divisional Electrical Engineer of the details in writing.  \\n The treatment laid down for resuscitation after electric shock shall be carried out immediately if applicable.  \\nThe treatment should be continued for at least two hours or more as there have been cases where patients, \\nalthough apparently dead, have regained consciousness.  \\n3. All electrical accidents occurring within Railway premises shall be reported to the Electrical \\nForeman/Chargeman in charge of the area and by him to the Sr. Divisional Electrical Engineer without delay, however slight the injury may be and even though the injured man is capable of performing his \\nduties. \\n \\n10502  Observance of Rules All accidents arising out of the use of electricity within the railway premises are required not only to be dealt \\nwith under the provisions of the ‘Rules for Reporting Accidents’ of the Zonal Railway but also according to the procedures under the Indian Electricity Act,. 1910, section 33 and Rule 44 A of I.E. Rules, 1967. \\n \\nSection 33 of I.E. Act 1910 reads as under: \\n 1. If any accident occurs in connection with the generation, transmission, supply or use of energy in or in \\nconnection with any part of the electric supply lines or other works of any person and the accident results \\nor is likely to have resulted in loss of human or animal life or in any injury to a human being or an animal, such person shall give notice of the occurrence and of any such loss or injury actually caused by the \\naccident, in such form and within such time as may be prescribed, to the Electrical Inspector and to such \\nother authorities as the appropriate Government may be general or special order, direct. \\n \\n2. The appropriate Government may, if it things fit, r equire, any Electrical Inspector, or any other competent \\nperson appointed by it on his behalf, to inquire and report: \\n \\na) as to the cause of any accident affecting the safety of the Public, which may have been occasioned by or \\nin connection with, the generation, transmission, supply or use of energy, or  \\n \\nb)  as to the manner in, and extent to, which the provisions of this Act or any license or rules thereunder, so \\nfar as those provisions affect the safety or any person, have been complied with. \\n \\n3. Every Electrical Inspector or other person holding any inquiry under sub-section (2) shall have all the \\npowers of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, for the purpose of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and compelling the production of documents and material objects; and every person required by an Electrical Inspector or such other person as aforesaid to furnish any information \\nshall be deemed to be legally bound to do so within the meaning of Section 176 of the Indian Penal Code.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME1     [51] 10503  Electrical Inspector to Railway \\n \\nThe Chief Electrical Engineer of each Railway is appointed to function as Electrical Inspector to the \\nCentral Government for the Railway vide Railway Board’s Notification No. 60/Elec/112/6 dt. 10th \\nJune 1961.  All matters in regard to the functions of  Electrical Inspector shall be referred to him. \\n10504  Reporting of Accidents \\n \\nThe Electrical Foreman/Chargeman s hall send in respect of every electrical accident a notice of the \\naccident in writing to the Electrical Inspector viz., Chief Electrical Engineer, through the Sr.DEE/DEE.  \\nIn case where the accident results in or is likely to have resulted in loss of human being or animal, \\nintimation shall be given within 24 hours of the k nowledge of the occurrence of the accident by \\nexpress telegram to be confirmed by a post copy. \\n \\nThe written report of the accident shall be sent in the form set out at Annexure ‘XIII’ of I.E Rules. \\n \\nAll fatal and grievous hurt accidents shall also be immediately reported to the nearest Police Station. \\nDistrict Magistrate or Sub-Divisional Officer in charge of the Civil Jurisdiction and the body (in case \\nof fatal accidents) shall not be moved until the Police Inquiry is completed.  \\nIn the case of electrical accident occurring with in workshop premises, the Factory Rules and Act will \\napply.  In this instance the “Manager” of the workshop will send the detailed report on the forms \\nprescribed in the Factory Rules to the Factory Inspector, in addition to CEE, CWE,DRM etc.  \\n10505  Accident Inquiries \\n \\nEvery electrical accident shall be inquired into by an officer and a report submitted to the Chief \\nElectrical Engineer (functioning as the Electrical Inspector for the Railways) giving complete \\ninformation within one week of the accident.  The report should in particular cover the following \\npoints:-  \\n1. A clear description of the locality and a sketch showing all the relevant details; \\n2. An analysis of the evidence recorded; \\n3. Findings as to the exact cause of the accident; \\n4. Fixing up of responsibility of staff negligence,  if any, indicating whether the “Rules for Safe \\nWorking on Electrical Equipment” have been followed or not: \\n5. Recommendations for preventing such accidents in future : and \\n6. Any special features peculiar to the case. \\nUntil the official inquiry is conducted all material evidence should be preserved by the official in-\\ncharge of facilitate the inquiry.  Where restoration of supply is likely to obliterate marks on the \\npremises or in any other way destroy evidence which may be of use in an inquiry, the Senior Electrical Official who first arrives at the site should carefully make notes and sketches and preserve \\nthe evidence as far as possible, for production at the inquiry. \\n \\n10506  Accident Registers and Annual Returns.       \\n Every Electrical Official in-charge shall maintain a register showing the particulars in regard to all \\nelectrical accidents taking place under hi s jurisdiction in the proforma below:- \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\nDate Time  Brief description Date & Time of   Date accident \\n   of the accident  issue of accident  report submitted \\n      Telegram \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME I    [52] \\n \\n He will also submit by 15th April of each year a statement of accidents during the previous financial \\nyear to Sr. DEE, who in turn will submit the statement for the entire division to the CEE for \\nincorporation in the Electrical Inspectors Annual  Report to CEA. \\n \\n10507  First Aid \\n \\nA box containing first aid equipment shall be kept in each generating station or each sub-station and \\nelectrical work depot (except where adequate medical fa cilities exist for all the 24 hours of the day) \\nclose at hand for use when required.  A periodical check shall be made of the contents and any deficiencies shall be reported to the M edical Department for replenishment. \\n \\nRESUSCITATION  FROM  ELECTRICAL  SHOCK \\n \\n10508  Instructions to be Displayed \\n \\nInstructions in English and the Regional language r egarding the treatment of persons suffering from \\nelectric shock shall be exhibited in all inspection sheds, stabling depots, repair shops, stations, sub-\\nstations etc. and it is the duty of every authorised official to make himself thoroughly familiar with \\nsuch instructions, and to be able to render artificial respiration when necessary.  Instructions regarding the methods of rendering artificial re spiration have been given in paras 10509 and 10510. \\n \\nElectrical shocks are easily received but are as easily avoided if proper precautions are taken in \\nmaintaining and handling electrical equipment. \\n \\n10509  Removal from Contact \\n \\nIf the person is still in contact with the apparatus that has given him the shock, the rescuer should, if \\npossible, stand on a dry wooden chair while removing the victim.  Otherwise pull him free by using a \\ndry coat, dry rope, coconut matting or stick, preferably standing on a rubber mat or any other dry \\nmat handy.  Never touch the man’s body with bare hands.  Extinguish any sparks if the patient’s clothes ar e smouldering; ascertain if he is breathing and send \\nfor a Doctor.  If apparently not breathing, proceed as described in para below. \\n \\n10510 Artificial Respiration \\n If there are any burns, avoid, if possible, so placi ng the patient as to bring pressure on the burns.  It \\nis preferable to operate as in the Diagrams A & B, Fig. 5.01, with the face downward.  If badly burnt \\nin front, turn to the second method shown later. \\n \\nFirst Method \\nFirst Motion :  Observe Diagram A – “Expiration”. Kneel over the patient, rest the hands flat in the small of his back, let your thumbs nearly touch, spread your fingers on each side over his lower ribs \\nas in the first diagram. \\n \\nNow lean firmly but gently forward over the patient, exerting a steady pressure \\ndownwards, still following the first diagram. \\n Second Motion : Observe Diagram B – “Inspiration”.  Rock yourself gently backwards but do not \\nremove your hands.   \\n  Merely keep then in position for the next expiration pressure. \\n \\nContinue these two movements. \\nThe double movement should be gone through about fift een times per minute.  The object is to keep \\nexpanding  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME I    [53] and contracting the patient’s lungs so as to imitate slow breathing. If the operator himself breathes \\nslowly, letting the air out as he presses forward, and drawing it in as he rocks backward, he will \\nnaturally arrive at the proper rate, and will understand the reason for the movements. \\n Do not cease operations until natural breathing is re-established. It may take half an hour or even \\nlonger, to produce a desired effect. \\n \\nSecond Method \\n Should it be expedient to place the patient on his back , first loosen the clothes around the chest and stomach. Then placed a rolled-up coat, or ot her improvised pillow, beneath the shoulders so \\nthat the head falls backwards. The tongue should then be drawn forward. \\n \\nFirst Motion : The operatoe must kneel in the posit ion shown by Diagram C. Grasp the patient just \\nbelow the elbows and draw his arms over his head until horizontal, retaining them there for about \\ntwo seconds. \\n \\nSecond Motion :  Next bring the patient’s arms down on each side of its chest and pressing inwards \\nupon his arms so as to compress his chest as in Diagram D.                              Remain thus for two seconds, and then keep repeating the two motions at the same rate. \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS- AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME I    [54] \\n \\n \\nThe lung-inflating effect in Diagram C is much assist ed if the arms be swung outwards as they are lifted. \\n \\nIf more than one person is present, the patient’s tongue should also be drawn out during each outward or \\nlung-inflating stroke (Diagram C) and released during each inward or lung deflating stroke (Diagram D). \\n In both case, be careful to avoid violent operations, as injury of the internal organs may result from excessive \\nand sudden pressures.  After recovery, burns if serious, should be treated with a proper oil dressing.  Avoid \\nexposing patient to cold.  Administer no restoratives until the Doctor comes.  Cold water may be given and smelling salts applied in moderation. \\n \\nTwo methods of treatment for electric shock have been described above.  It is the duty of every railway servant to be familiar with these method s of rendering artificial respiration. \\n \\n10511 Typical Electrical Accidents \\n Brief particulars of a few electrical accidents which have actually occurred are given below.  A study of these \\nparticulars will help officers and staff in appreciating the importance of the various safety rules prescribed. \\n 1. A khalasi of the Engineering Department, engaged in construction work, sustained severe burns when \\nhandling a long boiler tube under live OHE.  The boiler tube accidentally touched the contact wire.  This \\naccident could have been prevented if proper supervision had been exercised and the Supervisor in-charge of the work had warned all his staff of the dang er of electrocution if the OHE is accidentally \\ncontacted by poles, ladders, pipes or tools.  Whenever there is even a remote possibility of any person \\ncoming within the danger zone of live 25 kV installation s at sub-station, Switching stations or if any work \\nhas to be done within 2 m of live OHE, the supervisory official in-charge should invariably obtain permit to \\nwork after the lines are made dead and earthed before allowing staff to start work. \\n 2. An electric fitter working on a locomotive stabled in a loco shed climbed on to the roof to examine the \\npantograph which was in the lowered position.  The height of the contact wire on the stabling line was 5.5 \\nm and the height from rail level of the pantograph in  the lowered position was 3.66 m.  The fitter was \\napparently under the impression that he could conveniently examine the lowered pantograph taking \\nadvantage of the clearance of nearly 2m.  Unfortunat ely, while he was examining the lowered pantograph, \\nthe other pantograph of the locomotive was inadvertently raised by another employee thus energising the \\nlowered pantograph also.  There was also danger of the employee getting a shock if he had inadvertently stood up on the roof in the course of his work.  This emphasizes that no one should ever get up on the \\nlocomotive roof when the locomotive is under a live OHE.  A shut down should invariably be effected \\nbefore climbing on to the roof of stabled locomotives. \\n \\n3. Two work parties were required to work at an insulated overlap connected together by an interruptor.  \\nShutdown was effected on both the elementary secti ons and the interruptor was also opened.  One party \\nearthed the OHE on one side of the insulated overlap and the supervisor of this party permitted  his men \\nto commence work on the insulated overlap without ear thing the other portion of the OHE presuming that \\nthe other portion had been earthed by the other work party.  This resulted in some of the workmen getting electric shock due to contact with the unearthed wires.  This accident emphasizes the importance of the \\nrules that (a) each party should protect itself by independent earths and (b) when work is to be done at an \\ninsulated overlap either both portions of OHE should be independently earthed or the electrical continuity between the two portions should be ensured by keeping isolators/interruptors closed. \\n \\n4. A supervisor took power block for two elementary sections supported on a portal and overlooked the fact \\nthat the same portal supported the wires of a siding.  Consequently a worker sent to work on the portal \\nstructure came into contact with the live OHE of the siding and sustained shock which resulted in his \\ndeath.  This serious accident could have been preven ted if the supervisor had made himself thoroughly \\nfamiliar with the details of OHE supported on the portal and had ensured that all the wires on the portal structure were made dead and earthed before permitting his men to commence work on the portal . \\n \\n  \\n \\n  INDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUMEI        [55] 5. An Electrical Chargeman (OHE Maintenance) received a fatal shock when he came into contact \\nwith OHE, which had been isolated but not earthed.  On completion of work , he removed the \\nearth and went down into the OHE Inspection Car to check up the time.  Subsequently, he went \\nup the OHE Inspection Car again and came into contact with OHE, which was not earthed though isolated.  A slight drizzle earlier contributed to the severity of the shock as the \\nChargeman’s feet and the tower wagon platform we re wet.  Due to parallelism with the live OHE \\nof an adjacent line, there was an appreciable induced voltage in the line, though it was isolated.  \\nThis emphasizes the need for ensuring that the OHE is earthed in accordance with the rules \\nprescribed before commencing work and during the whole time the work is in progress. \\n 6. An Assistant Driver of a diesel locomotive of a Steel Works doing shunting work in an electrified \\nyard close to the Steel Works received a severe shock when he went up on the roof of the \\nlocomotive.  The warning notice regarding live OHE was not painted on the locomotive nor was \\nthe Assistant Driver properly instructed on the hazards of working in close proximity to live OHE.  \\nThis emphasizes the need for painting the warning notice not only on the locomotives belonging \\nto the Railway but also of private parties likely to  work in electrified railway yards.   Operating \\nstaff of private parties also should be educated in the safety rules prescribed. \\n \\n7.   A Linesman  received a  severe shock when working on an  isolator.  Before commencing the work one  earth has been placed on each side of the isolator.  However, during the course  of the work, the \\nisolator was opened when the Linesman  received a shock.  The possible cause is that one of  the \\ndischarge rods was not making proper contact with the result that effect of induced voltage on  that \\nportion of the OHE caused the shock.  This em phasizes the need for ensuring that when working  \\non an isolator, either the isolator is kept  jumpered or not opened at all during  the course of the \\nwork , in addition to  the precaution that an earth should be placed on each side of the isolator. \\n \\n8)   Supply from an auxiliary trans former has failed .  An unskilled khalasi was sent by the fitter to \\ncheck up and renew the  high voltage fuses.  The khalasi attempted to do this without  getting  a \\npermit to work, accidentally  came into contact with live 25kv wires and was electrocuted .  This accident was  a direct result of an unauthorized  person not holding  a certificate of competence being  deputed to work on live equipment.   \\n \\n9)  An electrical fitter  was electrocuted while carring out repairs to a jumper connection to a \\ntransformer.  He had isolated the transformer and cl imbed up the pole to repair the jumper .  He had \\nposted  a helper near the circuit breaker with  instructions that on receiving a signal from him, the helper  should  close  the circuit  breaker .  The helper saw a person at a distance waving  his hands and presuming that the signal is fr om the fitter, closed the circuit  breaker .  The accident was the \\nresult of adopting short circuit  methods rather than the prescribed procedure for effecting shut down \\nand issue of permit to work .  Such short circuit methods are not permissible even if  the intention is \\nto speed up the work. \\n  \\nThe above cases would illustrate that a heavy responsibility rests with officers and senior \\nsupervisory officials to prevent possibilities of electrical accidents not only by insisting on strict \\ncompliance with rules and procedures laid down for safe working on electrical equipment, but also \\nby giving wide publicity to the need for utmost precautions on the part of everyone when working in electrified sections.                  \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n INDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION – VOLUME    - I            (56) \\n \\n  CHAPTER VI \\n \\nFIRE PRECAUTIONS. \\n    \\nPara No.           Subject \\n \\n10600        Duties of Electrical Department Staff \\n10601         Classification of Fires  \\n \\n10602         Precautions to be Observed  \\n \\n10603         Fire Extinguishers  \\n \\n10604         Training of Staff  \\n \\n10605         Technical Investigations of Fires  \\n \\n10606         Fire Accidents  \\n \\n10607         Organisation for Fire Fighting  \\n \\n10608         Maintenance and Inspection of Fire Extinguishers   10609         Code of Practice for Prevention of Fires of EMU Stock   \\n   \\n  \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n           \\n \\n  INDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME I   [57] \\n CHAPTER VI \\nFIRE PRECAUTIONS \\n10600 Duties of Electrical Department Staff  \\n \\n1 It is the duty of every railway officer and super visor to ensure by periodical inspections that \\ninstallations, offices, shops and rolling-stock under his control are: -  \\n \\na) well protected against risk of fire;  \\n \\nb) well equipped with  fire-fighting  equipment, and  \\n \\nc) that staff are well trained and fire-fighting appl iances are properly maintained to fight the fires, \\nshould they       develop.  \\n \\n2.   The majority of fires are preventable if only those in charge are security minded and make it a \\npoint to check the installations under their control from the point of view of fire risk and take necessary  precautions. Accumulation of debris and rubbish near offices, workshops and \\ninstallations should never be permitted even from the point of view of cleanliness -- much more so \\nbecause it is such accumulations that are responsible for most fires.   \\n3.    Points which should be checked during periodical inspections are :-  \\n \\na) Whether the fire fighting appliances are maintained in working condition, and if each installation \\nhas the full  \\n       complement of fire buckets, extinguishers etc.  \\n \\nb)   How well staff are trained to fight a fire.  \\n \\nb) Whether close liaison is maintained by the local official with the Fire Fighting Organization and \\ntelephone   \\n       numbers of Fire Station are properly displayed.  \\n \\nc) When the last fire drill was conducted, a fire drill register should be maintained at each \\ninstallation by  \\n       subordinate incharge.  \\n \\n10601 Classification of Fires  \\n \\nFor all practical purposes the basic types of fires can be grouped into following four classes;  \\n \\nClass A Fires:  \\n \\nFires involving combustible materials of organic  nature, such as wood, paper, rubber and many \\nplastics, etc., where the cooling effect of water is essential for extinction of fires.   \\nClass B Fires : \\n \\nFires involving flammable liquids, petroleum produc ts, or the like, where a blanketing effect is \\nessential.   \\nClass C Fires:  \\nFires involving flammable gases under pre ssure including liquefied gases, where it is  necessary to \\ninhibit the burning  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1      [58] \\n gas at fast rate with an inert gas, powder or vaporizing liquid for extinguishment.       \\nClass D Fires:  \\nFires involving combustible metals, such as magnes ium, aluminium, zinc, sodium, potassium, when \\nthe burning metals are reactive to water containing agents, and in certain cases carbon dioxide, \\nhaloginated hydrocarbons and ordinary dry powder s. These fires require special media and \\ntechniques to extinguish.  \\n10602 Precautions to be Observed  \\n1. Class A Fires:  \\n \\nFires of this type can be readily extinguished by wa ter or a solution containing large amount of water \\ndue to the cooling and quenching effect of water.  \\n \\nThe following precautions should be taken to prevent Class A Fires: -  \\n \\na) Glowing cigarette butts and matches shall not be th rown into waste baskets, oil rag bins, or other \\nplaces of fire hazard.  \\n \\nb) Smoking and use of open flames shall be prohibited in oil storage rooms, battery rooms and places where combustible material is kept.  \\n \\nc) High standard of cleanliness shall be maintained. Waste material, oily waste or rags etc. shall be \\nremoved from the premises daily and suitably disposed of.  \\n \\nd) Trees and rank vegetation shall not be permitt ed to grow in the neighbourhood of sub-stations, \\nswitching stations or other buildings. Roofs of bui ldings and the whole area of the sub-stations and \\noffices shall be kept clear of dry leaves, packing cases or other dry combustible material.  \\n \\ne) Before starting welding and cutting operations, it shall be ensured that sparks arising therefrom \\ndo not lodge in wood-work or ignite other combustible material in the area.  \\n \\nf) While installing heating device, hot water pipes, etc. suitable clearances from the combustible \\nmaterial shall be maintained.  \\n \\n2. Class B Fires:  \\nFor extinguishing these fires some blanketing agent is required such as foam which deprives the fire \\nof its oxygen requirement. If water is used, there is greater danger of the fire spreading.   The following precautions are required against Class B fires :-   \\na) Cable trenches inside stations containing cables  shall be filled with sand or pebbles or covered \\nwith non- inflammable slabs.  \\n \\nb) Oil-filled containers and equipment in receiving stat ions, sub-stations, buildings, store rooms, etc. \\nbe so located that fire and smoke from oil is not likely to do any damage.  \\n \\nc) Concrete dykes or floor drains and loose rock -filled pits shall be provided near oil storage rooms \\nand oil filled equipment to prevent spread of  spilled oil [(I.E. Rule 64 (2) (e) ].  \\n \\nd) Empty oil drums, boxes or other combustible material shall never be piled near storage oil tanks \\nand oil-filled equipment.  \\n \\ne) Petroleum containers shall be labelled and kept securely stoppered.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 1         (59)  f) When a vehicle is re-fuelled or petrol transfe rred from one container to another, no smoking or \\nopen flames shall be permitted in the vicinity.  \\n \\ng) Places where paints, varnishes, lacquers, thinners, etc. are stored or used shall be kept \\nscrupulously clean.   \\n3.  Fires in Electrical Equipment:  \\n  \\nFires that occur in electrical equipment or in equipment close to electric circuits preclude the use of \\nwater spray or foam type extinguishers. Such fires are extinguished by employing some insulating \\nagent like sand, carbon tetra- chloride or carbon dioxide or halon type fire extinguishers.  \\n \\nThe following precautions are required against such fires: -   \\na) Electrical equipment shall be installed, oper ated and maintained properly and in such a manner \\nas to eliminate arcs due to poor contacts in switches and fittings, damaged insulation, crossed \\nwires, opening of switches carrying large currents, etc.  \\n \\nb) Leakage on and/or overloading of circuits with   consequent heating up of wiring  must he guarded \\nagainst.  \\n \\nc) Motors shall be equipped with over-current and under-voltage protection to prevent excessive \\nheating.  \\n \\nd) Insulation strength of the equipment and cable shall be checked periodically.  \\n \\ne) Temperature and loading conditions of the equipment shall be recorded and studied.  \\n  \\nf) Electric lamps shall not be surrounded by  or laid on combustible material.  \\n \\ng) The vicinity of cables should be kept clear of oily dirt or other combustible material.  \\nh) Battery rooms shall have no loose connections and there shall be no sparking devices e.g., bells, \\nbuzzers, relays, fuses or switches in the room. Smoking shall be prohibited and rubbish and other \\ncombustibles shall not be permitted to accumulate in the battery room.  \\ni) Metal parts of oil tanks, electrical equipment and buildings shall be adequately bonded and \\nearthed to prevent fires by lightning and static electricity. The earth resistance shall be checked \\nperiodically.  \\n \\nj) Flammable gases and materials shall not be stored near electrical equipment.  \\n \\nIn designing, electrical installations in buildi ngs, Indian Standard 1646 (Code of Practice for Fire \\nSafety of Buildings (General): Electrical Installations and IS 3034: Code of Practice for Fire Safety of \\nIndustrial Buildings: Electrical Generating and Distributing Stations )should be followed.  \\n \\n10603 Fire Extinguishers  \\n1. The types of extinguishers mentioned below against each class of fire are generally most suited. Details of suitability as a guide of each type of extinguisher is, shown in Table 1. It may, however, \\nbe noted that this is only for guidance and does not cover special cases.  \\n \\na) Class A Fires - Water expelling type extinguishers.  \\n \\nb) Class B Fires - Foam, dry powder, vaporizing liquid, carbon dioxide extinguishers.  \\nc) Class C Fires - Dry powder and carbon dioxide extinguishers.  \\nd) Class D Fire - Extinguishers designed for expelling special dry chemical powder.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL  –VOLUME I        [60]  \\nTable 1 \\n \\nSuitability of Different Types of Fire Ex tinguishers for Different Class of Fires \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ \\nS.No.  Types of Extinguishers       Types of Fires  \\n       ------------------------------------------- \\nA   B  C  D \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ \\n \\n1.

NS  - not suitable,  @ - suitable if special dry powder for burning metal is used.  \\n 2. Where the energized electrical  equipment is involved in a fire, the non-conductivity of the \\nextinguishing media is of utmost importance and only extingushier expelling dry powder or carbon \\ndioxide (without metal horn) or halon should be used.  Once the electrical equipment is de-\\nenergized and extingusher suitable for Class A, B and C  Fires may also be used safely. \\n Where cleanliness is of importance and contam ination of sensitive electrical equipment \\nshould not be caused, only carbon dioxide or Halon type fire- extinguishers should be used in case \\nof fire in such equipment. \\n3. At times it may become necessary to use water from a fire hydrant to control a major fire \\ninvolving electrical equipment or in the vicinity of electrical equipment. In such cases, it must be ensured that the electrical equipment is made dead before using the fire hydrant. \\n10604 Training of  Staff \\n1. Sr. DEEs concerned should ensure that cate gories of staff listed below are adequately \\ntrained in fire precautions:- \\ni) Drivers, Motormen, Asst. Drivers, Engine Tu rners:- They should be fully familiar with \\nthe physical location of fire fighting equipment in locos/EMUs and the correct method of operation of the equipment including the precautions to be followed. Guards of \\ntrains hauled by electric locos and of EMU trains should be similiarly trained by the \\nOperating Department. \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS AC TRAC.TION MANUAL - VOLUME 1     (61)  ii) All supervisors and skilled artisans of Loc o and EMU sheds, OHE depots, PSI & RC sections:- \\nThey should be familiar with the physical location of all fire fighting equipment including fire hydrants \\nin their place of work, the correct method of operating the equipment and precautions to be \\nobserved, as well as location of and means of summoning of Railway and Municipal Fire Brigades. \\nImmediately after coming on duty the supervisor must daily check the fire fighting equipments.  \\n \\n \\n2.   The Security Department of the Division will train the staff in operation of fire fighting equipment \\non requisition from the Electrical Department. A register should be maintained in each Loco/EMU \\nshed, OHE depot, TF(R)\\'s office etc. indicating the name of staff who have been so trained. Divisional Fire Inspector be contacted for advice and training in fire fighting.  \\n 10605 Technical Investigations of Fires  \\n \\n1. Constant study and investigation of causes of fires are very essential. Every case of fire minor or \\nmajor, irrespective of the location, whether in power, auxiliary or control circuits, should he investigated very carefully, even though an enquiry in accordance with the Accident Rules may not \\nbe called for. The causes as established by the investigation should be analysed by the SR.DEE \\nperiodically to identify areas requiring further in vestigation and to tighten up preventive measures. \\nThe Divisional Fire Inspector should always be associated in any fire enquiry.  \\n \\n2.  A report on each case of fire should also be furnished to CEE as well as the Divisional Fire \\nInspector concerned.  \\n10606 Fire Accidents  \\n1.   Fires in trains, whether carrying passengers or not, resulting in loss of human life or injury to any \\nperson or loss of or damage to railway property to the extent of Rs.500 or over are required to be \\ntreated as \"accidents\" and have to be inquired into in accordance with the \"Rules for Reporting and \\nInquiring into Accidents\". Fires in other railway prem ises resulting in damage to railway property of \\nRs.500 or over are also to be treated as \"accidents \". Fire accidents involving loss of human life or \\ninjury to persons or damage to railway property esti mated to cost Rs. 300,000 or over have also to \\nbe reported as soon as possible on telephone to the Railway Board by the Operating (safety) Branch.  \\n \\n2. When electrical installations or electric rolling- stock are involved or when there is possibility that \\nthe fire was caused by electrical short circuit or due to defect or malfunctioning of electrical \\nequipment, a representative of the Electrical D epartment should invariably be a member of the \\ninquiry committee. Rules also require that a re presentative of the Security Department should be \\nassociated with all inquiries into fire accidents.  \\n \\n3.   The composition of the inquiry committee and the method of disposal of the report of the inquiry \\ncommittee will be as laid down in the \"Rules for Reporting and Inquiring into Accidents\" issued by  \\nthe Zonal Railway, with which the officers and supervisor should be fully conversant.  \\n \\n10607 Organisation for Fire Fighting  \\n 1.  On each railway a fire-fighting organisation exis ts primarily to look after major fires and to render \\nhelp to the Department in imbibing good fire fighting practices and achievement of high fire fighting \\nefficiency.  \\n2.  The administration and control of the Fire Service organisation in the Zonal Railways is under the \\ncontrol of the Chief Security Commissioner of the Railway with an Assistant Security Commissioner \\n(Fire) in direct overall charge of the work in the Headquarters office. ASC (F) is a specialist officer responsible not only for exercising technical supervi sion over the fire service organisation on the \\nentire railway but also for advising other Departments in regard to fire precautions.  \\n3.   The day-to-day control over all Fire Fighting uni ts in the divisions is exercised by the Divisional \\nSecurity Commissioner of the Division/Security Officer of the Division.  \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME I      (62)   \\n 4.  The responsibility for providing adequate fi re fighting equipment, initially as well as on \\nreplacement account, rests with the Departments concerned. The type and scale of fire fighting \\nequipment to be provided in each installation as also on rolling-stock should be decided on the \\nadvice of ASC (F).   \\n5.  All fire fighting equipment in traction installations, loco sheds etc. excluding the mobile fire \\nengines and trailer pumps, if any, should be born e on the books of the Electrical Department. The \\nmobile fire engines and trailer pumps will  be on the books of the Security Department.  \\n \\n6.   Repairs and maintenance of the fire fighti ng equipment will be underta ken by Fire Service \\nSection of Security Department .Detailed local instructions should be issued jointly by the Sr. \\nDivisional Electrical Engineer concerned and the Di visional Security Commissioner fixing the \\nperiodicity of inspection of the fire fighting equi pment by the Security Department, the procedure for \\nrequisitioning the services of the Fire Serv ice personnel for repairs and maintenance of the \\nequipment and similar connected matters.  \\n \\n7.   Officers and supervisors in charge of traction installations and rolling-stock will render all \\nnecessary assistance to the Security Departmen t in inspection, maintenance and operation of the \\nfire fighting equipment. Although ultimate responsibility for efficient working of fire service \\norganisation is that of the Security Department, the officials of Electrical Department may also \\norganise surprise fire drills in loco and EMU sheds, OHE depots etc. and record the same in Fire \\ndrill register.  \\n \\n10608 Maintenance and Inspection of Fire Extinguishers   1. Inspection and testing:  \\nRoutine maintenance of all fire extinguishers in respect of mechanical parts, extinguishing media \\nand expelling means should be carried out by properly trained personnel at frequent intervals but at least once in a month to make sure that these are in their proper condition and have not been accidentally discharged or lost pressure or suffered damage. Following procedure should be followed for monthly maintenance, inspection and testing. Divisional Fire Inspector should be \\napproached for this purpose.  \\n \\na) Clean the exterior of the extinguisher :polish the painted portion with wax polish, the brass parts \\nwith metal polish, chromium plated parts with silver polish.  \\nb) Check the nozzle outlet vent holes and the threaded portion of the cap for clogging and check \\nthat plunger is  in fully extended position and is clean.  \\nc) Check the cap washer, grease the threads of cap plunger rod and wipe clean.  \\nd) Make sure that the extinguisher is in proper condition and is not accidentally discharged. In case \\nof stored pressure extinguisher, pressure gauge is to be checked for correct pressure.  \\ne) Check all mechanical parts thoroughly.  \\nf) All fire buckets should be refilled, some with clean water and others with dry sand and checked \\ndaily by the supervisor incharge of the maintenance.  \\n2.    Annual Inspection  \\nAt least once in a year, inspection and maintenance of extinguisher, including chemical charge \\ninside and expellent should be carried out by tr ained personnel. Any extinguisher showing corrosion \\nor damage to the body internally or externally  should be replaced. Faulty, damaged and corroded \\nparts shall be replaced by correct componen t. Illegible labels should be replaced.  \\n10609 Code of Practice for Preventi on of Fires of EMU Stock  \\nGuide lines for prevention of fires on EMU stock have been laid down in Code of Practice for \\nPreventon of Fires of EMU stock (first revision) issued by RDSO in October 1991.  \\n \\nThe Code lays down detailed instructions regarding prevention of fires on the EMU stock which is \\nnewly built and also instructions regarding prevention of fires on EMU stock already in service.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME I     (63)   CHAPTER VII  \\nENERGY CONSERVATION  \\nPara No.      Subject  \\n10700     Monitoring of Energy Conservation  \\n10701     Energy Conservation Measures  \\n10702    Energy Conservation Measures for Traction Installations  \\n10703     Energy Conservation Measures for Rolling Stock  \\n10704     Energy Conservation Measures for Maintenance Installations  \\n10705     New Developments  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN    RAILWAYS   —   AC   TRACTION   MANUAL   -    VOLUME    1  (64) CHAPTER VII \\nII. ENERGY CONSERVATION \\n \\n10700 Monitoring of Energy Conservation  \\n \\n1.  The Staff connected with electric traction shall make every effort to avoid wastage in use of \\nelectricity through constant vigil.  \\n \\n2. One Senior Administrative Grade Officer of Electrical Department shall be nominated by Chief \\nElectrical Engineer to be incharge of matters pertaining to Energy Conservation. The officer shall :  \\n \\n      -   Monitor pattern of consumption of electrical energy on electrified divisions based on the \\nreports from        Divisions;  \\n \\n     -    Plan for Energy  Conservation measures and m onitor their implementation;  \\n \\n     -     Provide guidance to Divisional Officers;  \\n \\n     -      Arrange for training of officers and supervisors;   \\n      -      Discharge other related functions.  \\n 3. Sr. DEE (TrD) and Sr. DEE (OP) shall hold mont hly meetings to analyze energy consumption and \\nmaximum demand for the preceding month vis-a-vis earlier months. The figures should have a \\nrelation to the traffic moved. In the event of maximum demand and energy consumption being found \\ndisproportionately high, a detailed investigation should be made and corrective action, if any, should he advised to concerned departments.  \\n \\n10701 Energy Conservation Measures   While development of better designs and use of energy efficient equipment will bring about \\nreduction in energy consumption, yet on the ex isting systems the following measures listed below \\nwill contribute to conservation of electrical energy in traction. While working to these recommended \\nmeasures no compromise shall be made with the safe and reliable operation of equipment and train \\nservices.   10702 Energy Conservation Measures for Traction Installations  \\n  \\n \\n1.   Shunt capacitor banks shall be provided at traction sub-stations, where not done, to reduce \\nmaximum demand and line losses. Priority should be given to the sub-stations feeding large \\nmarshalling yards.  \\n \\n2. Standby traction transformers should be kept de-energized to save on no load losses.  \\n \\n3. Demand monitoring equipment, wherever provi ded, shall be maintained in the working order.  \\n 4. Traction Power Controller should co-ordinate with the Section Controller to avoid simultaneous \\nstarts of trains, as far as practicable. Bunching  of the train in the event of breakdown has to be \\navoided to the extent feasible.  \\n \\n5. Wherever standby emergency power supply is also derived from OHE, the associated auxiliary  \\ntrans- \\n \\n INDIAN  RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 1         (65)     former should be kept isolated from 25 kV side to avoid no load loss. This, however, shall not be \\napplicable for power supply to signals w here changeover has to be immediate.  \\n  6.   Ensuring of good electrical contact to attain low resistance at conductor joints (splices ) and \\nparallel groove (PG) clamps through periodical inspection and maintenance.  \\n \\n7.   Connections to buried rail opposite sub-stations  for return current are prone to corrosion leading \\nto increased resistance and loss of energy. These connections should be inspected periodically and maintained to obtain good electrical connection.  \\n \\n10703 Energy Conservation Measures for Rolling Stock  \\n \\n1. Drivers/Motormen are expected to be well - conversant with the road to make the best use of \\ndown gradients to effect maximum possible saving in energy consumption.  \\n \\n2.  In level sections and particularly in suburban sections, coasting should be resorted to as much as possible and brake applied only when essential to control the speed or stop the train. To help Drivers and Motormen \"Coasting Boards\" are fix ed at appropriate points on suburban sections. In \\nsome Railways, time totalizers have been provided in EMUs.  \\n \\n3.  In the undulating terrain, speed may be allo wed to drop down when going up a short up-gradient. \\nAfter passing over the crest, the train will automatically pickup the speed with power off when going \\ndown- hill, so that it attains maximum permissible speed on the section when it arrives at the foot of the next up-gradient. This feature should receive special emphasis during learning the road period.   \\n4.   Re-scheduling of booked speed of EMU to help conservation of energy.   10704 Energy Conservation Measures for Maintenance Installations  \\n \\n1. Switch  off lights, fans and air conditioners when not required.  \\n \\n2.  Keep standby transformers deenergized from HV side . \\n \\n3.  Check idle running of machines.  \\n \\n4.   Check leakage and misuse of compressed air.  \\n \\n5.   Check leakage and wastage of water.  \\n \\n6.   Maximise use of natural day light in service building to reduce need for electric light.   \\n10705 New Developments  \\n  \\n1.  The traction staff should keep themselves fully  abreast of technological developments like 3 \\nphase drive Electric locos being made elsewhere, within the country and abroad, in respect of \\nefficient utilization of electric power in tracti on applications and try to derive benefits from such \\ndevelopments.  \\n \\n2.   Electric locomotives simulator : Training of Drivers on simulator can help drivers in running of \\ntrains with optimum consumption of energy.  \\n \\n3.

Instructions in this \\nChapter are supplementary to the provision of the Code.  \\n \\n10801 Standardization of Stores   \\n \\n1.   All items for which the demand is recurring and in sizable quantities should be standardized and \\narranged to be stocked in the concerned Stores Depots.  \\n \\n2. The work of standardization and issue of stocking advice to the Stores Branch should be dealt with by a separate section in CEE\\'s Office. W hen a new item is required to be standardized, the \\nSR.DEE concerned should send a preliminary proposal  to CEE giving the description of the item, \\navailable details of specifications and drawings, where item is proposed to be used, estimated \\nannual consumption, basis of the estimated consumption, likely sources of supply and other \\nrelevant details. The proposal will be carefully scrutinized in CEE\\'s office and if standardization is considered justified, a complete proposal, as pr escribed by the Stores Department will be forwarded \\nto COS, who will arrange to include the item in the \\'Standard Nomenclature List of Stores under \\nadvice to the Stocking Depots and the Sr.DEEs concerned.  \\n \\n3. Standard drawings and specifications for some items to be used by more than one Zonal Railway \\nare also issued by RDSO .  Items required exclus ively by a Railway will be covered by drawings and \\nspecifications  issued by CEE. Sr.DEEs may is sue local specifications and drawings for items \\nrequired to be purchased once or only occasionally.  \\n \\n10802 Stock Items and Special Requisitions  \\n 1. Items having a recurring consumption should as a rule be only obtained through the Store Depots. Procurement of stores against requisition for direct delivery by the trade to the consuming \\nunits should be avoided except in the following cases;-  \\n \\na) Items which have a very low annual consumption and hence cannot be included as stock items \\nand at the same time do not fall within the definition of \\'Emergency\\' stores e.g., bearings of \\nparticular sizes only a small number  of which may be required per annum.  \\n \\nb) Stores required for special works, modifica tions or programmed replacement of parts,  \\n \\nc) Items, although stocked by the depot, which have a non-recurring demand for a specified \\npurpose and cannot be met from the stocks held for normal consumption e.g. , cables required for \\nspecial rewiring of locos and EMUs.  \\n \\nd) \\'Break-down Stores\\' such as OHE conductors and other stores to be held by OHE depots to meet \\nunforeseen contingencies such as thefts and accident.  \\n \\n \\n   INDIAN  RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL –VOLUME I    [68]  \\n e)   Non-standard items and other items required regularly but not stocked by stores Depots, \\npending standardization.  2. Quantities to be obtained against requisitions for (b) and (c) above should be on the basis of approved estimates for each item for the specified purpose. Quantities against (a), (d) and (e) should be generally equal to the anticipated consumption for one year or for such longer period as convenient for procurement, fixed in consultation with the Stores Department, taking into account \\nthe normal delivery period for the anticipated consum ption during the period required for receipt of \\nfresh stocks according to normal delivery anticipated for each item plus a buffer stock to cover 6 \\nmonths requirements. On the basis of experience it should be possible to fix this minimum level \\nquantitatively for each item.  \\n 3.   Requisitions for non-stock stores and special requisitions for stock items as above are required to be scrutinized personally in regard to specification and quantity and signed by Technical Officers \\nof appropriate rank. Officers/Supervisors initiating such requisitions should enclose a brief note for \\nthe information of the officer empowered to sign the requisition, bringing out the need for the procurement and explaining how the quantity has been arrived at.   10803 Emergency Stores  1.  \\'Emergency Stores\\' comprise items of stores wh ich do not ordinarily wear out or require renewal, \\nwhich have, however, to be kept in stock to meet, emergencies, such as that due to breakage or \\nunanticipated deterioration, and which are not readily obtainable. The stock cards relating to such stores should be marked with the letter \\'E\\'.   \\n2.  When an item is to be stocked as \\'Emergency Stores\\', the Sr. DEE concerned should, in \\nconsultation with DCOS/ACOS in-charge of the depot, obtain CEEs personal sanction giving \\nadequate justification.  \\n \\n3.   The list of \\'Emergency\\' items should be reviewed annually by the Sr. DEE and the Depot \\nOfficers concerned. It may be possible to transfer some of the items to ordinary stock and to dispose off items no longer required on account of obsolescence.   \\n10804 Imprest Stores  \\nStores with a regular recurring consumption required by OHE depots, PSI depots, etc. and for \\noutstation maintenance of rolling-stock should be arranged against \\'charged off\\' imprests. The \\nprocedure as detailed in the Stores Code should be followed in regard to sanction, recoupment and \\naccountal of such stores.   \\n10805 Proprietary Articles  \\n1. Proprietary articles are required to be purchas ed from the specified firm on single tender basis. \\nOnly when acceptable alternatives cannot be used a \\'Proprietary Article Certificate\\' be issued. The \\nofficer signing a Proprietary article certificate should satisfy himself on this point.  \\n \\n2.  A proprietary Article Certificate in the prescr ibed form should be issued only by technical officers \\nof appropriate rank. The name and designation of th e officer signing the certificate should be clearly \\nindicated in the certificate.  \\n \\n3.   While the greatest care should be exercis ed before issuing a Proprietary Article Certificate, \\nwhen the Department officer is personally satisfied t hat the item of the required quality can only be \\nobtained from the original manufacturer, there should be no hesitancy in issuing the Proprietary Article Certificate.   \\n10806 Estimates for Stock Items  \\n1. The procedure to be followed by stores depots in compiling annual estimates for stock items is \\ngiven in Chapter VI of the Stores Code. In regard to traction items, the quantity should be vetted and countersigned by Sr.DEEs concerned before submissi on of the estimate sheets by the Depots to \\nCOS.  \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS  -AC TRACTION  MANUAL- VOLUME I    [ 6 9 ] since the Stores Department has to follow a rigid time table for preparation and submission of the \\nestimate sheets, Sr.DEEs should have suitable machinery for expeditious scrutiny and return of the estimate sheets when received.  \\n \\n2.   In scrutinizing the estimate sheets Sr.DEEs may, if necessary, suggest modification of the \\nquantities arrived at by the depot giving specific  reasons. These suggestions should be considered \\nby the Stores Department before finalizing the Estimate Sheets.  \\n \\n3.   Another important check to be made by Sr.DEE s when scrutinizing the Estimate Sheets is to \\nsee whether all the items included will actually be used. If there are many items which have become \\nobsolete, they should be discontinued.   \\n \\n10807 Items with Protracted Delivery   \\n1  The minimum limit should be a quantity of sto ck representing an average weekly issue multiplied \\nby the number of weeks, which from past experience,  it is known will lapse from the date of placing \\nan order before fresh stocks can arrive at the depot.   \\n2. In fixing the minimum stock  for traction item s,the protracted delivery periods for imported items \\nand items  for which the approved sources are limited, should be invariably taken into account and \\nan adequate buffer stock also fixed to ensure that the items do not go out of stock due to delayed \\nsupply or other reasons.  \\n \\n10808 Local Purchase by DRM  \\n1. The power of local purchase delegated to DR M should be made use of by Sr. DEEs to the \\nminimum extent necessary to meet urgent requirements of stores only. Detailed local instructions should also be laid down to regulate the scrutiny of demands for local purchases as well as \\naccountal of stores purchased in this manner.  \\n 2.  Stores Code lays down the powers of DRM fo r local purchase of stores. DRMs are also \\nempowered to re-delegate these powers to lower authorities.   \\n10809 Specifications  \\nProcurement of stores should be arranged against st andard specifications wherever possible. Local \\nspecifications when framed should be clear and precise in regard to requirements, tests etc. It must \\nbe remembered that a vague specification may result in incorrect supply. It may also attract offers which do not meet the Railway\\'s requirements, but at the same time are difficult to be ignored, necessitating cancellation of tenders and re-tendering, which result in infructuous expenditure, apart \\nfrom delay in procurement.  \\n \\n1 0810 Preparation of Indents  \\nWhen indents are prepared, the essential points to be borne in mind are listed below   a)  The description should he complete and written out clearly. Figures in the description (e.g., kW rating) should be spelt out also in words. If the s pace in the standard form is not sufficient to write \\nout the description in full, it should be given in a separate attached sheet, preferably typed.  \\nb)  When mention is made of a local drawing or sp ecification, requisite number of copies should be \\nattached, taking care that these are with the latest amendments.  \\nc)  The quantity should be invariably given in words and figures in the respective columns.  \\n \\nd)   The designation and full postal address of the consignee and the controlling officer should be \\ngiven to facilitate correct dispatch of Railway Receipt and other documents.   \\ne)  When a non-standard item is ask ed for, particulars of the last supply, if any, should be given to \\nenable the Store Department to locate likely suppliers.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME I          [70]  f)  When the requisition is for a proprietary article, the ordering reference as given by the Manufacturer should \\nbe quoted and carefully tallied and a Proprietary Article Certificate in the prescribed form should be attached, \\nduly signed and countersigned by the Competent Authority.  \\ng)  The rate should be either on the basis of last purchase rate suitably adjusted for price variations or on the \\nbasis of actual market quotations or a reasonable estimate. It will be helpful if the basis on which the rate is quoted is mentioned on the indent itself or in the covering letter.   \\nh)   The chargeable head of account should be correctly indicated. \\ni)   Any corrections should be initialed by the officer signing the requisition.  \\n 10811 Imported Stores .  \\n \\n1.  .All  demand for stores involving imports should be meticulously scrutinized by the indenting officer to \\nensure that the requirement is for minimum quantity possible.  \\n \\n The procedure involved  in import is summarized  below : -  \\n i) On receipt of tenders, if import is found necessary, the stores Department will prepare a \\'Foreign Exchange \\nProposal\\' in the prescribed form. The possibility of obtaining an alternative available from indigenous sources, \\nif any, will be carefully considered by a Committee of o fficers before import is considered. A higher price, upto \\ncertain limits is also admissible for indigenous stores.  \\n \\nThe foreign exchange proposal will be personally coun tersigned by the Head of the user Department, after \\nsatisfying himself that import is inescapable and also that the quantity asked for cannot be reduced. The proposal accompanied by its justification is then vetted by the Accounts Department and then forwarded to the Railway Board.  \\n \\nii) In  every case the requisite foreign exchange requires sanction by the Railway Board, either against \\nallotment made periodically by the Ministry of Finance or after getting special clearance from that Ministry, \\nwhere large amounts of foreign exchange is released, clearance is also required from the Directorate General \\nof Technical Development.  \\n \\niii) On receipt of sanction for the foreign exchange, th e Stores Department will issue a Purchase Order to the \\nfirm concerned, the delivery period stipulated counting from the date of issue of import license.  \\n \\n(An import license where the quantity imported is meant  solely for use of the organisation sponsoring the \\nissue of license is called an \\'Actual User\\'s license\\'. Sometimes, firms offer stores imported against block licenses in their own possession in which case the Railway does not have to assist them in obtaining an \\nActual User License).  \\n \\niv) On receipt of the Purchase order, the firm will submit an application for import license in the prescribed \\nform quoting reference to the Purchase Order, which will be scrutinized and forwarded by the Stores Department to the Chief Controller of imports, New Delhi, through the Railway Liaison Office, New Delhi. When an import license is issued, the purchasing authority is also advised.  \\n \\nImport License is valid for a stipulated period. If the item  is not imported within that period, the license requires  \\nre-validation by the issuing authority.    \\n2. Because of the involved procedures as above, all requirements for imported stores should be foreseen well \\nin advance and indents placed in time. A time lag of two years or more is not unusual between the placing of indent and actual receipt of the stores.  \\n \\n3. A register should be maintained in the CEE\\'s office listing out every approved case for imported equipment. \\nThis register should be scrutinized every month by a no minated officer, to keep track of the progress and to \\ntake prompt steps if there is any hold-up.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1        (71)  4.   Defective Imported Equipment: Sometimes imported equipment are found on receipt to be defective, \\nhaving suffered damage during transit before the equipment are cleared from the port. Such defects/damages \\nshould be noted and a certificate obtained from the port authorities. Such defects/damages are usually \\ncovered by Insurance and replacements will  have to be obtained.  \\n \\nOccasionally some imported equipment are found to have inherent manufacturing or other defects, after they \\nare put into service. If they are covered by guarantee, the railways are entitled to obtain free replacements. The Contractor of firm concerned will  then have to obtain another import license duly supported by a certificate issued by the Railway to import the replacement. Where the defective part has to be returned, an export/import license will have to be obtained by the firm.  \\n \\n5. With changes in Govt. policy regarding import, certain changes in procedure are being progressively \\nintroduced. Indenting officials should make themselves familiar with such changes.   10812 Follow UP  1. When issuing  reminders to the Stores Department regarding supplies due against requisitions placed, care should be taken to give complete references such as description and quantity of item, indent number and \\ndate, forwarding letter number and date etc. Each reminder should be self-contained in regard to these \\ndetails.   2. In the case of stores to be received directly against purchase orders, consignees should arrange to notify the Controlling Officer, COS/DCOS/DGS & D who has pl aced the purchase order and the firm on whom the \\norder has been placed, if supply or dispatch advice is no t received by the due date. Prompt advice of failure of \\nsupply to materialize by the stipulated date will  enable the Purchasing officer to take up the matter with the \\nsupplier and arrange alternative procurement, if required.   \\n10813 Check on Bills  \\nDetailed instructions issued by the Stores Department are available in regard to the procedure to be followed \\nfor checking and passing of supplier\\'s bill. The \\'original\\' bill is sent to the consignee and the \\'duplicate\\' to the \\ncontrolling officer. The original bill checked and signed by  the consignee is sent to the controlling officer for \\ncountersignature and onward transmission to the suppli er under advice to the bill passing Accounts Office. A \\nfew illustrative points in regard to technical and ot her checks to he exercised by consignees and controlling \\nofficers are explained below for guidance. These are supplementary to the procedural instructions of the Stores Department referred to above: -   \\n1. Sometimes Purchase Order are placed FOR destination station. Freight then is required to be borne by the suppliers and the accepted rate is inclusive of this. In some other cases Purchase Orders specify dispatch of the stores FOR dispatching station, when freight is to be borne by the consignee. Only in the latter case \\nshould the consignee ordinarily give a credit note to cover the freight charges. In the case of the first type of \\nPurchase Order i.e., FOR destination, if erroneously the stores are booked by the supplier \\'freight to-pay\\', the freight, for which a credit note is given by the consignee, is recoverable from the bill and the controlling officer \\nshould be advised accordingly.  \\n \\nTo avoid errors of this type, it is advisable for consignees to maintain separate registers, preferably in different \\ncolors, to register purchase orders of the two types.  It should also be remembered that loss suffered by the \\nrailway due to such errors is recoverable from the supervisor responsible.                                           2. Inspection of the equipments supplied should be carried out carefully in accordance with the specifications and drawing mentioned in the Purchase Order. Metallurgical tests should invariably be arranged through the Chemist and Metallurgist of the Railway when required, pa rticularly for OH E fittings, alloy steel components \\nfor rolling-stock etc., where strict adherence to the spec ified material is very important. Test certificates \\nproduced by the suppliers are of doubtful reliability,  unless they are from re cognized laboratories.  \\n \\n2. Quantity check should be carried out carefully, number, weights and lengths stated by the suppliers \\non packages should he checked at random and based on these checks, if required, 100 per cent checks should be carried out. Where Railway samples have been made available to the manufacturer these should \\nbe taken back and accounted for. \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS-AC TRACTION MANUAL- VOLUME   I    [72] 4. The quantities accepted are required to be entered forthwith in ledgers and the details of entries shown on \\nthe bills before they are certified. Contro lling Officers should test-check these entries  frequently.  \\n \\n5. Where the supply has been received after, the due da te stipulated in the order, sanction of the Competent \\nAuthority should be obtained before the supply is accepted.   \\n3. In the event of rejection, a letter should be ad dressed to the firm forthwith detailing the reasons and \\nduly  countersigned by the controlling officers.  Rejected supplies when dispatched by rail  to the supplier, should be invariably sent ‘ freight to pay’.  Rejected supplies not removed  by local suppliers from the \\nconsignees premises within the stipulated time are liable to levy of storage charges as laid down by local \\ninstructions.  \\n \\n7. Occasionally suppliers allow a small rebate if their bills are passed within a specified period. This condition \\nis incorporated in the order itself at the time of analyzing the order or it may be indicated by the Supplier when \\nsubmitting his bill. Such bills specially watched and pass ed in time, both by the c onsignee and the controlling \\nofficer, to take advantage of the rebate admissible. It should, however, be noted that tests required to prove \\nthe quality of the supply should not be waived me rely to pass the bill by the stipulated date.  \\n \\n8. Occasionally, orders are placed on ‘time preference\\' basis i.e., a lower quotation is passed over and higher \\nquotation accepted to take advantage of the earlier delivery offered by the latter. In such cases delivery of \\nsupplies after the stipulated date will automatically invo lve certain penalties on the supplier. Acceptance of \\ndelayed supplies against time preference orders should be in accordance with instructions on the subject issued by the Stores Department.   \\n10814 Break-Down Stores  \\n \\n1. The breakdown stores should be kept earmarked for use in breakdowns and should not ordinarily be \\ndiverted for normal  maintenance work or against sanctioned works. Such diversion may be resorted to only in \\nexceptional circumstances and  with the prior written approval of competent authority.  \\n \\n2. As soon as the authorized minimum limit for any particular item has been reached, stock should be \\nrecouped by placing requisitions and by effectively chasing supplies.   \\n3. The maximum and minimum limits should be reviewed periodically by Sr.DEE and revised as required \\nbased  on experience.  \\n \\n108 15 Stores for Works  \\n \\nOfficers and Supervisor in-charge of maintenance have to often execute sanctioned minor works such as \\nelectrification of additional sidings new cross-overs etc. The basic rules to be followed in regard to procurement and accountal of stores for  such works are as under -  \\n \\n1. For each work a detailed estimate is required to be sanctioned by the competent authority before any \\nprocurement of stores for the execution of the work is initiated. The stores indented for the works should only be in accordance with the sanctioned detailed estimates. Even though detailed estimates for certain new minor works are not required a rough estimate should be prepared and got approved by Sr. DEE, incorporating therein a list of stores required for th e purpose. When placing indents, availability of funds \\nagainst the sanctioned budget should be invariably certified by the works accountant for receipt and issue of \\nstores.  \\n2. A tally book should be maintained separately for each sanctioned work to account for receipt and issue of \\nstores.  \\n3.Maintenance stores should not ordinarily be drawn for use against works. \\n Transfer of stores to and from a sanctioned work should invariably be authorized by competent authority and covered by adjustment memo. \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS- AC TRACTION MANUAL- VOLUME I     (73)  5. On physical completion of a work surplus stores received against the work and stores released, if any, on \\nexecution of the work, should be disposed off in the manner authorized by SR.DEE.  \\n  \\n10816 Liaison with Stores Department  \\n \\n1. Officers and nominated supervisors at the Divisional and Shed/Workshop level should be in touch with the \\nstores depots in regard to the supply position of stores required by them. By scrutiny of the depots in cards it \\nshould be possible to anticipate if any critical situat ion is likely to develop due to non-availability of any \\nparticular item and to initiate timely measures for Purchasing up supplies.   2. A meeting should be held periodically at agreed intervals between stores officers and traction officers at the Divisional/Workshop level. Apart from general review of the stores position, a detailed review of vital items should be carried out so as to foresee in time difficulties likely due to short-supply of any item and to decide \\non measures to be taken to forestall such difficulties. Matters requiring decision of Executive officers such as \\nreview of annual requirements of particular items, clarif ications regarding specification etc. are best discussed \\nand settled, at such meetings rather than by correspondence.   \\nMinutes of such meetings should clearly bring out items on which action is required to be taken by the \\nDivisional/ Workshop electrical officers, Stores Depot Officers and headquarters officers. Meetings should also \\nbe held at agreed intervals at headquarters level between officers of the stores and Electrical Departments, to \\nreview the position and to settle matters requiring deci sions at headquarters level.  The minutes of meeting \\nheld at Divisional/ Workshop level should generally be the basis of discussions at the meetings in the \\nHeadquarters office.  \\n 3. During their visits to Stores Depots, electrical officers should particularly check the manner in which \\nelectrical stores are stored/stacked and guide the Depot officials for safe storage. Particular attention should \\nbe paid to shelf stacked items such as varnishes, resins and other explosive/inflammable materials.  \\n \\n10817   Custody and Accountal of Charged-Off Stores  \\n1. In loco and EMU sheds the receipt, custody and issue of charged-off stores mentioned should be under the \\nsupervision of the DCOS/ACOS attached to the shed. An experienced supervisor of the Electrical Department may be posted to work under the day-to-day control of the DCOS/ACOS to look after this work and to assist him in technical matters as required.   \\n2. In OHE depots, PSI depots and outstation rolling- stock maintenance depots, su ch custody and accountal \\nwill be the responsibility of the supervisors incharge of th e depots. Delivery of such stores from the trade to \\nthe depots should be routed through the nearest stores depot, except in special circumstances.   \\n1 0818 Inspection of Stores  \\n \\n1. The responsibility for inspection of stores and the procedure for inspection have been defined in paras 757 \\nand 761 of the stores code reproduced below;-   \\n\\'757. Inspection:  All stores purchased direct by the Controller of Stores should ordinarily be inspected by an \\nInspecting Officer of the Railway. When however, the Controller of Stores, places an order for stores with instructions to dispatch the materials directly to an Indenter, the Indenter is responsible for the inspection and for arranging for suitable tests to be carri ed out where he considers these necessary.  \\n \\n\\'761. Procedure of  Inspection:  Stores should be checked with the standard specification or drawing on which \\nthe order is based. In the rare cases where orders have been made to a sample, a standard sealed sample shall be held by the Inspecting Officer and Stores accepted only if they are up to the standard sample’.   \\n2. Sr. DEE should assist Stores Depots in regard to technical inspection of stores received by the depots. \\nSuch inspections should not be merely left to subordinates. Sr.DEE/DEE should carry out surprise checks as often as possible to make sure that accepted items do comply with the specifications and items rejected are for sufficiently valid reasons. All inspection reports should be sent to the Stores Depots countersigned by an officer.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME I    (74)  10819 Inventories of Dead Stock  \\n Inventories of Dead Stock (i.e.,Tools and plant Re gisters) should be maintained in accordance with \\nthe rules contained in the Stores Code.  \\n \\n10820 Safe Custody of Stores  \\n During periodical inspection, officers and supervisors should critically review the adequacy of security precautions against possibility of pilfer age,loss; damage or misuse of stores held by \\nthemselves or their subordinates and take preventive action as necessary.  \\n \\nFor each establishment, clear standing instructions should be available defining the procedure to be followed and fixing the responsibility for-   a) Locking and sealing of stores,   \\nb) Custody of keys and  \\n c) Opening the stores in the event of any emergency arising during non-working hours and on  holidays.   \\nOfficers should, during their inspections, make it a point to check that the prescribed procedure is in \\nfact being followed.  \\n \\n10821  Accountal and Disposal of Scrap, Emptys etc.  \\nCare should be exercised in the accountal and disp osal of scrap, unserviceable stores and empties. \\nThis applies particularly to non-ferrous scrap such  as copper conductors and non-ferrous fittings, \\nwhich being costly are liable to be pilferred. In view of this the Sr,DEE/DEE should as soon as possible after renewals make regular checks to  ascertain whether the quantities brought on the \\nbooks are commensurate with quantities expected to be released. Such scrap should be disposed on in the manner laid down in the Stores Code. Similarly empties such as oil drums, cable drums, packing cases etc. should be accounted for and disposed of in the manner laid down in  the Code.  \\n \\n10822 Condemnation Certificates  \\n \\n \\nThe general rule governing the condemnation of assets is contained in para 716 of the General \\nCode, VolumeI which is reproduced below:  \\n \\'Scrapping, condemning and abandoning asse ts: An asset may be scrapped, condemned or \\nabandoned without replacement, when the service rendered by it is no longer required. If the service \\nrendered by it is still necessary and if it is propos ed to make other arrangements for such service, it \\nshould be definitely established that it is more economical to scrap condemn or abandon the \\nexisting asset and obtain the required service from  the new arrangement than to continue to obtain \\nthe required service from the existing asset. Here also the relative economy of the two proposals \\nshould be assessed on the basis of the average annual cost of service or the cost per unit of service as the case may be’.      \\nWhen important components used in traction installa tions or rolling-stock such as traction motors, \\nrectifier assemblies, auxiliary machines, circuit breakers, control panels, section insulators, \\nmachinery, testing  instruments etc., are to be condemned, the SR.DEE should personally inspect \\nthe item and satisfy  himself that it is beyond economic repairs. A  Condemnation Certificate detailing \\nthe reasons for condemnation should be issued to the subordinate supervisor authorizing him to \\nreturn the item to the Store Department as unse rviceable. In the \\'Advice of Return Stores\\' the \\nreference to the condemnation certificate issued should invariably be quoted.  \\n \\n2. In the case of electric locomotives and EMU coaches which have completed their normal life, \\ncondemnation has to be sanctioned by CEE and CME following the procedure prescribed for the \\npurpose and obtaining FA &  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL-VOLUME-I      [75]  CAO\\'s  concurrence. Similarly CEE and CME can sanction with Finance concurrence the \\ncondemnation of over- aged electric locomotives and EMU coaches which have not completed their normal life. It requires sanction of the Railway Board based on the joint recommendation of CEE \\nand CME and concurrence of FA & CAO.  \\n \\n10823 New for Old  \\nIn accordance with para 1839- certain items ca n be obtained from the St ores Department only in \\nexchange for corresponding old items. A list of items which should be obtained only by exchange in \\nthis manner is also given in the Stores Code. It is  important that in regard to such items the \\nprocedure laid down is strictly followed.  \\n \\n10824 Verification of Stock  \\nInstructions for verification of stock by stock verifiers of the Accounts Department are contained in \\nthe Code.  \\n \\n2. Each stockholder should verify his stocks once in six months. He may do so by verifying certain \\nitems every month provided the whole stock is verifi ed in the course of six months prior to April and \\nOctober every year. The date of verification should be entered in the relevant page of the tally book/tally card along with the signature and desi gnation of the official. Excesses and shortages \\ndiscovered during the verification should be dealt with as laid down in the Code.  \\n 3. Officers should carry out test verification of stock with Stock Holder under them to cover important \\nitems the charged-off and surplus stocks and items in which deterioration is liable to occur, such as \\ninsulating varnishes and lubricants with limited shelf-life. The test verification should not be confined to new items only, but should also include second-hand stores and scrap returned to stock and \\nreleased from works.  \\n \\nDuring the test verification the officer should initial tally books and ensure that - \\n \\nA) The materials and tools are borne against proper classifications;  \\nb) Surplus stores for which no immediate use can be found are referred to SR.DEE for orders \\nregarding disposal;   \\nc) Unserviceable items that have scrap value are returned to the Stores Department;  \\n \\nd) Unserviceable items that have no scrap value are written off with Sr.DEEs approval and a \\ncertificate recorded to this effect;   \\ne) Repairable or reconditionable items are sent to workshops with work orders;  \\n \\nf) Contents of tools and materials in Break-down Trai n, Wiring Train, Tower Wagon, OHE Depot etc. \\nare in ready-for-use condition and to the approved scales;   \\ng) The issues shown are commensurate with require ments. Heavy issues soon after receipts should \\nbe particularly scrutinized carefully.  \\n \\n4. DEE/AEEs should carry out such test verification of stores of all their subordinates atleast once in \\n6 months and Sr. DEEs once per annum.   \\n5. Verification of balances are made periodically by  stock verifiers of the Accounts Department to \\nwhom every assistance should be afforded. The stoc k verification sheets should be signed jointly by \\nthe Stock Holder and the Stock Verifier.   \\nDiscrepancies should be explained, but no adjustments should be made until orders have been \\nreceived from SR.DEE. The necessary receipts and issues should then be shown in the ledgers and \\nreturns with remarks and references to the order of SR.DEE.  \\n \\n10825 Computerized Stores Accounting  \\nWith computerization of stores accountal, cert ain changes in procedures are being progressively \\nintroduced with which indenting officials should make themselves familiar.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME I    [76] \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCHAPTER IX \\n \\n \\nQUALITY ASSURANCE & RELIABILITY ENGINEERING  \\n \\n     \\nPara No.          Subject  \\n \\n10900           General  \\n \\n10901             Definition of Quality  \\n 10902            Purchase of Spares  \\n10903            Application of Reliability Engineering  \\n \\n10904      Employees Participation  \\n \\n \\nAnnexure 9.1 - Note on Quality Management  \\n \\nAnnexure 9.2  - Note on Reliability Engineering.  \\n  \\n \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nINDIAN RAJLWAYS - AC TRAC\\'TION MANUAL VOLUME I    [77]  \\n CHAPTERIX    \\nQUALITY ASSURANCE & RELIABILITY ENGINEERING   \\n \\n10900 General  \\n \\nIt shall be endeavour of every official to take steps towards quality in their set-up to improve \\nproductivity. Quality Assurance involves effects towards quality improvement, quality development \\nand quality maintenance to meet service requirem ents at economical levels. This would require \\nenhancing quality of products, services and activities.  \\n \\n10901 Definition of Quality  \\n \\nUse of quality spares for maintaining traction assets plays a vital role in their reliable operation. \\nQuality of a product/ equipment is defined as compliance with the following :  \\n \\na)  The specifications as established by the purchaser and accepted by the supplier;  \\n b) The design details as declared by the s upplier and accepted by the purchaser; and  \\n \\nc) Sound engineering practice though not specifically defined either in the specifications or in the \\ndesigns.  \\n \\nA note on scope of quality assurance, quality aspects in manufacturing, system of acceptance \\nsampling, quality, indices for acceptance is given in the Annexure - 9.1 for reference.   \\n10902 Purchase of Spares  \\n \\nThe following  guide-lines have been laid down for purchase of quality spares: (ref. Board\\'s letters \\nnos. 73/RS(G)/ 30/RLL dt. 30.3. 87 & 17.2.89).   \\nThe various components, sub-assemblies and spare parts shall be purchased from \\noriginal/approved suppliers. Railways  will however make out a compendium of RDSO approved manufacturer\\'s list. Any variation from the same  shall only be permitted personally by the Chief \\nElectrical Engineer.   10903 Application of Reliability Engineering  \\n \\nTo improve quality of service and improve availa bility of equipment for operations, application of \\nconcept of reliability engineering is also being cons idered as one of the scientific approaches in use. \\nA note on Reliability Engineering is enclosed as Annexure-9.2 for reference.   10904 Employees Participation  \\n \\nParticipation of employees in Quality Circles and quality improvement is essential for Quality \\nManagement of services. It is to be remembered that  Quality involves every one in the organisation, \\nmanagement, workers towards improving performance at every level to build an organisational \\nculture where the quality improvement are embedded into the work and the activities.   \\n \\n     \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS  AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1    [78] Annexure 9.1 \\n  \\n \\nNOTE ON QUALITY MANAGEMENT \\n1. Scope of Quality Assurance  \\n  \\n1) Quality Assurance consists of the measures ta ken to ensure that three conditions listed below are \\nfulfilled.  \\n \\na)  The specifications as established by the purchaser and accepted by the supplier ;  \\n b)   The design details as declared by the supplier and accepted by the purchaser; and  \\n \\nc) Sound engineering practice though not specifically defined either in the specifications or in the \\ndesigns.   \\n2. The main aim or objective of Quality Assu rance is to prevent any defect form appearing or \\ndeveloping in the work done and not merely to detect and reject defective work.  \\n \\n3. While occasional rejection requiring rework or r eplacement is not ruled out, the objective is to \\ntake every possible step to eliminate the basic or root causes of defects.   \\n4. It is also the purpose of Quality Assurance to maintain records in such detail and manner as to \\nfacilitate investigations into problems or failures that may arise during the life time of the work done.   \\n2. Quality Aspects in Manufacturing  \\n \\nThe specific quality aspect in manufacturing includes : \\n \\n1. Choice of machines, processes and tools capable of maintaining the tolerances.  \\n2.   Choice of instrument of an accuracy adequate to control the processes.  \\n3.   Planning the flow of manufacturing information and criteria.  \\n4.   Planning of process quality controls.  \\n5.    Selection and training of production personnel.  \\n6.     Planning the quality aspects of purchasing and shipping.   \\n3.    Planning  Through Trial Lots  \\n \\nThe trial lot is used to \" clear the tr ack\" for full scale production by: -  \\n \\n1. Proving that the tools and processes can indeed turn the product out successfully.  \\n \\n2.   Proving, on test, that the product will  process the essential functional features.  \\n \\n3.   Proving,  on use, that the product  will  achieve the desired field performance.  \\n 4.   Remedying the deficiencies in manufacturing  process of product before embarking on full scale \\nproduction.  \\n \\nThese proofs and remedies cannot be provided from t he record of samples made in the pilot plant. \\nIn the pilot plant the basic purpose is to prove engineering feasibility, in the production shop the \\npurpose is to meet standard of quality, cost and delivery. The pilot plant machinery, tools, \\npersonnel, supervisions, motivation, etc. are all different from the corresponding situation in the \\nproduction shop.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  - VOLUME I     [79]  \\n  4. Acceptance Sampling  \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\n \\n1. 1 Acceptance Sampling is the process by which decisions are taken either to accept or to reject \\nan entire \\'Lot\\' of products offered for inspection, on the basis of detailed 100 percent inspection of \\none or more samples drawn at random from the lot.  \\n \\n1.2 The number of items to be dr awn from each sample, the number of samples to be drawn from \\nthe lot and the number of permissible detectives in each sample, constitute what is known as the \\nSampling Plan.  \\n \\n1.3 Acceptance Sampling is based on the mathematics of Probability and Statistics. Sampling plans \\nare generally selected from publ ished tables to suit the expected quality levels.  \\n \\n1.4 The following  Indian Standards must be stud ied by all Engineers concerned with Inspection and \\nQuality Control.   \\na)   IS  397       -Methods of Statistical Quality Control During Production    \\n \\nb)  IS  1548       -Manual on Basic Principles of Lot Sampling  \\n c)  IS  2500        -Sampling Inspection tables  \\n \\n                      Part I  - Inspection by Attributes and by Count of Defects. \\n                       Part II - Inspection by Variables for Percent Defective . \\n d)  IS 5002        - Methods for Determination of Sample Size to Estimate the Average Quality of a Lot or Process.  \\n \\n2.      Quality Indices for Acceptance Sampling  \\n \\n2.1    Acceptable Quality Level (AQL):  \\n \\nThis is usually defined as the worst quality level that is still considered satisfactory. The units of quality level can be selected to meet the particular needs of a product. Thus, “MIL-STD-105 D\" \\ndefines AQL as \"the maximum percent defective (or the maximum number of defects per hundred \\nunits) that, for purposes of sampling inspection, can be considered satisfactory as a process \\naverage.\" If a unit of product can have a number of different defects of varying seriousness, then \\ndemerits can be assigned to each type of defect and product quality measured in terms of demerits.  \\n \\nAs an AQL is an acceptable level, the probability of acceptance for an AQL lot should be high (see Figure 9.01)   \\n2.2  Rejectable Quality Level (RQL):   This is a definition of unsatisfactory quality. Different titles are sometimes used to denote an RQL for example, in the Dodge-Romig plans, the term \"Lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD)\" is used. As \\nan RQL is an unacceptable level, the probability of acceptance for an RQL lot should below (see \\nFigure 9.01). In some tables, this probability is known as the consumer\\'s risk designated as Pc and \\nhas been standardized at 0.1 .  \\nThe consumer\\'s risk is not the probability that the c onsumer will actually receive product at the RQL. \\nThe consumer will in fact not receive 1 lot in 10 at RQL fraction defective. What the consumer actually gets depends on actual quality in the lots before inspection, and on  the probability of \\nacceptance.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME I       [80]  \\n 2.3 Indifference Quality Level (SQL):  \\nThis is a quality level somewhere between the AQL and RQL.   It is frequently defined \\nas the quality level having a probability of acceptance of 0.50 for a given sampling \\nplan (see Figure 9.01).  \\n \\n2.4  Average Outgoing Quality Limit  \\nA relationship exists between the fraction of defectives in the material before \\ninspection (incoming quality p) and the fraction of defectives remaining after inspection \\n(outgoing quality AOQ) : AOQ= pPa. Obviously, when  incoming quality is perfect, \\noutgoing quality must likewise be perfect. However when incoming quality is very bad, \\noutgoing quality will still be perfect because the sampling plan will cause all lots to be \\nrejected and detailed inspected. Thus at either e xtreme -incoming quality very good or \\nvery bad - the outgoing quality will tend to be very good. Between these extremes is \\nthe point at which the percent of defectives in the outgoing material will reach its \\nmaximum. This point is known as the average outgoi ng quality limit (AOQL).  \\n3.    Sampling Plans  \\n3.1Normally, Sampling Plans have to be specified clearly by the purchaser because it is \\nessential to have  agreement on this issue between the   Purchaser and the Supplier. \\nWhen so specified, the sampling  plans should be followed scrupulously by the \\nInspector.  \\n3.2When the specification does not include Acceptance by Sampling and if the Inspector \\nconsiders that  100 percent inspection is neither practicable nor necessary, a \\nreference should be made to the  purchaser.  \\n3.3Different Sampling plans may be adopted for different properties or parameters of the \\nitems to be inspected. More important properties may be checked on sample of larger \\nsize.  \\n \\nINDIAN    RAILWAYS   —   AC   TRACTION   MANUAL   -   VOLUME   1  [81] 3.4  Where the items being inspected are being pr oduced by fully automatic machines the sample \\nsize specified may be smaller than in the case of manually produced items. It is desirable in such \\ncases and also in general when lots of identical items are inspected repeatedly, to carry out the \\ninspection in the same sequence as manufacture.  Control charts should also be maintained to \\nenable timely detection of dimensions going beyond permissible limits. Whenever the machine is \\nreset or retooled, 100 percent inspection should be carried out by the manufactur\\'s Inspection \\norganisation until consistently good results are obtained.  \\n \\n4.  Random Sampling  \\nThe conclusions drawn, relating to the quality of a whole lot on the basis of a 100 percent check on \\na sample, can be relied upon only if the sample is sufficiently large and the sample is selected in a \\ntotally unbiased or random manner. Above all, the selection should not be influenced in any manner \\nby the Supplier\\'s suggestions or actions. The quality of acceptability of an item should not determine the choice of items for the sample. Even the inspector himself should try to avoid any inadvertent or \\nunintended bias in the selection of the sample. This can be ensured by using a table of random \\nnumbers.   \\n5. Sample Size  \\n \\n5. 1 One item drawn from a lot of any size cannot be relied upon to give any idea of the quality of \\nthe lot except in the case of fluids or fluid-like fine powders which have been thoroughly mixed  \\ntogether. In these exceptional cases a small quantity-apparently a single sample-will give a reliable \\nmeasure of the whole lot.  \\n \\n5.2 The Sample size, i.e. the number of items incl uded in the sample, is very important. It increases \\nwith increasing lot size-but not in the same proporation. For example, for an AQL of 0.65 :-   \\nLot Size                       Sample Size                     Sample Percentage  \\n \\n100                               20                                      20  \\n1000                            125                                     12.5            \\n3000    200            6.7  \\n \\n6.  Limitations of Acceptance Sampling  \\n \\n6. 1 The limitations of Acceptance Sampling are as  follows : \\n a) Acceptance Sampling involves some uncertainty or risk. For instance, it is not possible to say with certainty whether any individual item taken from a lot which has been accepted by Sampling, is good or bad. Therefore, Acceptance Sampling should not be adopted where defects are not acceptable in even one item as, for example, in Safety Items.  \\n \\nb) It is possible to estimate the percentage of g ood or bad items in a lot accepted by sampling with \\nadequate accuracy and confidence, only if all the rules of sampling are followed strictly.  \\n \\nc) If an incorrect sampling plan is adopted or if sample selection is  not properly randomized there is \\ndanger of very bad lots gettng accepted.   \\n6.2 Where large quantities or numbers of identical items have to be inspected, the advantage of \\nacceptance Sampling outweigh its limitations. Moreover, destructive tests have necessarily to be based on \\'Sampling\\' basis.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS --AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME I      [82] \\n  \\nAnnexure 9.2  \\n         NOTE ON RELIABILITY ENGINEERING  \\n1.   Introduction  \\n \\nReliability Engineering is not totally new to engineers. They have always been practicing the essentials of reliability engineering without giving it this name or using its terminology.  \\n \\n1.1. Reliability engineering is the discipline concerned with the prevention of defect, failures, fires, \\naccidents etc., in all types of hardware from the smallest items like hand tools to the largest units like loco- motives, boilers, turbines etc. This discipline has been successfully applied in a number of complicated and baffling cases to reduce the breakdow n rate of equipments, improve the availability \\nof plants for operation and thus to help in reduction of costs and improvement of efficiency and \\nproductivity.  \\n \\n1.2. Even though the overall or general design of the multitudes of types of hardware are widely \\ndifferent, the detailed design of components as al so the mechanisms of failures are generally \\nsimilar. The basic principles of reliability engineering can be applied to identify the root causes of \\nfailures such as weak links in the systems, starting points of material failures, causes of \\nworkmanship defects, degradation   processes, and many other such factors which usually lie \\nhidden under the obvious causes of failures.  \\n \\n1.3. Reliability engineering is most appropriate for repetitive types of failures which continue  to \\noccur again and again despite various measures bei ng taken to avoid these failures. In such \\nintractable cases, the user has either to suffer the failures continuously or to take the burden of replacing the entire equipment in question. Such  intractable cases have been solved economically \\nby the application of the principles and methods of reliability engineering.   \\nWhile the basic principles of design, manufacture and maintenance differ widely between the fields \\nof civil, electrical, mechanical or signal & tele communication engineering, across all these specialist \\nbranches cuts the new disciplines of reliability engineering. The modes and mechanisms of failures \\nof all types of hardware are the same and the st atistical/ mathematical methods for understanding \\nand studying them all, are identical.   \\n2. Basic Principles  \\n \\n2.1Definition of Reliability  \\n \\nFormally, reliability is the probability that an item will perform as required,  under stated condition, for \\na stated period of time. Thus if we have a large number items on test, we can write:-                              Number surviving at present          Reliability at time t      =   R(t)   --------------------------------------- \\n          Number at start \\n2.2.Failures  \\n \\nWhen an item no longer works as intended we say it has failed. Therefore, \"Failure is the \\ntermination of the ability of an item to perform its required function.   \\n2.3. Classification of failures. \\n Failures can be classified as follows : \\na) As to Cause:  \\n\\'Misuse failure\\' is a \\'failure attributable\\' to t he application of stress beyond the stated capability of \\nthe item. Thus it has been ill treated. An \\'inherent weakne ss failure\\' is a failure inherent in the item \\nitself,  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1     [83]  \\n  b) Constant failure period:  \\n \\nOnce the early failures have been removed, the parts usually settle down to what may be a \\nrelatively long period, when the failure rate is approximately constant.  \\n \\nDuring the constant failure period, it is usual for failures from a wide variety of causes occur at \\nrandom with no obvious pattern, except that the failure rate is roughly constant. Such failures are \\nalso commonly called random or chance failure. Where failures do form a well defined pattern the \\nreliability engineer calls them \\'systematic fail ures\\' and such patterns usually provide valuable \\ninformation about the cause of a failure.  \\n \\nc) Wear out failure period:  \\n \\nThe incidence of failure in this period is high since most of the component will have exceeded their \\nservice life and consequently would have deteriorated.  \\n \\n2.5. Failure Mechanism:  \\n \\nA few of the common failure mechanisms are  \\n \\nAdherence                   Deterioration     Piezo electric defect \\nArcing   Diffusion     Radiation damage \\nBacklash  Drift and shift     Secondary Current \\nBleeding  Dynamics out of limit    Seizure Carbonisation  Electric Breakdown    Silver migration Composite behaviour Erosion     Slip Contact bounce Fatigue     Smearing Contamination  Fretting or galling    Sublimation Corona  Frequency effect    Voltage Breakdown \\nCreep   Leakage     Voltage overload \\nCreep rupture  Magnetic hy streresis    Wear \\nCross talk  Mass unbalance      - Current Overload  Noise      Decarbonisation Opens \\n \\n2.6. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):  \\n \\nWhere the failure rate is approximately constant, it is  convenient to use the Mean Time between \\nFailures (MTBF). The mean time between failures is  the reciprocal of the failure rate. It should be as \\nlong as possible.  \\n \\n2.7.Mean Time To Failure (MTTF):  \\n  \\nThe term mean time to failure is analogous in every way with mean time between failure and is used \\nwhere a failure can not be repaired.  \\n \\n \\n INDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME I   [85] \\n \\n 2. 8. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR):  \\n \\nIt is the mean time taken to put the equipment right after it has failed. It should be as short as \\npossible.  \\n \\n2.9. Availability:   \\nIt is the probability that an equipment will be available for use and is given by the following \\nrelationship:  \\n           MTBF  \\nAvailability =    -----------------  \\nMTBF + MTTR  \\n \\n3. Failure mode effect and cr iticality analysis (F-MECA)  \\n \\na) F-MECA method is used very widely at the design stage for estimating the reliability of any new \\nsystem.or product and, more importantly, for evolving more reliable designs through the identification of vulnerable or failure prone components.  \\n \\nb) The method is described in United States MI L - STD-1629 (Procedures for Performing a Failure \\nMode, Effects and Criticality Analysis). The basic prin ciple of this method consists of listing all the \\ncomponents of an equipment or system and to evaluate, the effects of each possible failure mode of \\neach component on the equipment or system as a whole. The results of failures are classified according to the severity of the effects.  \\n \\nc) This method was originally developed mainly for electronic equipment but it can be applied \\nequally well to heavy electrical equipment or even mechanical equipment or systems.  \\n \\nd) Formal application of F - MECA methods is certainly useful for evaluating or designing complex \\nsystems but there is another advantage of learni ng this system. It gives an insight to the engineer \\nwhich is useful for not only designing but also for investigating failures of small equipment or components. Therefore, it is useful to study this system for even those who will not be called upon to apply it for designing, evaluating or improving complex systems.  \\n \\ne) Although F-MECA methods as defined in MIL-STD-1629 were originally developed for the \\npurpose of evaluation of reliability of electronic equipment at the design stage, it is possible to \\ndevise a variation which is suitable for a complex operational system such as the Railways, not so \\nmuch for designing the system as for evaluating the effects of various failure modes on \\nperformance. Such an analysis will help to place in th e proper perspective different types of failures \\nwhich occur everyday. The overall picture -so produced will help the top management firstly to \\ndetermine the most effective application of available resources and secondly to asses the \\neffectiveness of measures taken to prevent any type failure.  \\n \\n4.   Failure Reporting and Corrective Action Systems (FRACAS)  \\na)   FRACAS system was originally designed for reporting and investigating systematically all \\nfailures which occur during the development of any new product. However, it can equally well be \\napplied to an organization such as the Indian Railways to systematize the action that needs to be taken to improve the reliability of the hardware. It is  as important for old designs of equipment which \\nhave been in service for many years as for new  equipments introduced into service recently. If the \\nvery first failure of each type on any new equipment  is treated as a problem to be investigated and \\ncorrected much time and money can be saved.  \\n \\nb) The starting point for the establishment of a FR ACAS is the constitution of a failure review group  \\n(FRG) comprising:  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME    [86] Divisional officer in-charge of maintenance.  \\n HQ officer in-charge of design/development   \\nAny other officers who could contribu te to the solution of the problem.  \\n \\nc)   The FRG should work as a team to solve the problem and not as a forum for fixing \\nresponsibility, preparing a report or commenting on failure reports. Its recommendations should aim \\nat practical and economical solutions. Where action is within their own powers or capacity the FRG should implement their decisions, if not, they shoul d consider it their responsibility to obtain the \\nrequired approvals from higher levels. They should  always keep in mind that the effort must always \\nbe to determine the technical solution in detail. Merely reporting the problems to manufacturers for \\nnecessary action is not the function of an FRG.   \\nd)  The FRG should meet at least once a week to  review the failure reports on the equipment under \\nconsideration and to determine the corrective actions.   \\ne)  Whenever any new equipment is commissioned an FRG should be set up. Similarly an FRG may \\nbe established for a few specific problems of old standing which may be causing concern. The FRG should remain in force until the reliability of the equipment attains the desired level.   f)  The starting points for an FRG are the source reports on defects, failures, observations on \\noperating irregularities etc. United States MIL-ST D-781 provides a description of failure reporting \\nmethods. The common elements of all such failure reports are:   \\n- description of failure symptoms  \\n- effect of failure  \\n-    immediate action taken  \\n- elapsed time after commissioning, after various maintenance schedules.  \\n- operating conditions  \\n-    date, time, place of failure  -    make, type, serial number of equipment and of component(s)  \\n- opinion of person writing the report regarding possible cause of failure  - design modifications, if any.  \\n \\ng)  Failure report forms should be designed to cover all the above details as also any other relevant \\ndata specific to the equipment in question.  \\n h)  Corrective action proposed by the FRG and approved for implementation should be clearly defined and its implementation on the entire population of the equipments in question should be watched.  Then performance after the corrective action should be monitored. The FRG for any particular equipment may be wound up only when the desired reliability level is attained.  \\n \\n5. Potential of Reliability Engineering   \\n5. 1 Design Stage  \\n \\ni) If the specification is drawn up carefully, it takes care of what we may call the \\'Gross\\' design \\nrequirements. If the equipment complies with t he specification and passes the tests stipulated \\ntherein, it will meet all the performance require ments and is unlikely to have any major defects \\nwhich could render it unserviceable in a short time. However, this is not enough. The number of ways in which things can go wrong is so large that careful scrutiny of design details in every \\ncomponent is essential. Such scrutiny is inescapable in the case of equipments being manufactured \\nby new firms for the first time. Even in the case of products made by reputed firms, if it is a new \\nproduct, it is desirable to carry out such detailed scrutiny of designs. Very often, apparently minor deviations or discrepancies. \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTIAON MANUAL  VOLUME I   [87] can lead to avoidable failures in service. It is in the interest of not only the user but also the supplier that the \\ndetailed working drawings are scrutinized by relia bility engineers familiar with the performance of the \\nequipments under actual service conditions. The only time such designs scrutiny can be waived is when an \\nidentical design has been in successful service for many years under identical conditions. Even in such cases \\nit is necessary to check that there has been no change in the detailed design of any component. Further, the opportunity should be taken to review the reliability and failure statistics to see whether any improvements in \\nthe design of the concerned components can be introduced.  \\n 5. 2 Manufacturing Stage  \\n \\ni)  It is always  not possible to visualize every thing at the drawing board stage. When the manufacture of the high prototype is undertaken, various problems may be exposed, particularly in the case of complex systems. \\nThe problems may relate to manufacture or to maintainability and reliability. Studies relating to \\nmaintainability/reliability must continue concurrently during the manufacture of prototypes.  \\n ii) As far as the actual method is concerned the best way in the long run to ensure reliability is to insist on a \\nfanatic or rigid adherence to drawings, process sheets and such other production documents. \\nRelaxations/deviations and even so called \\'improvements\\' in process should be reviewed carefully by both basic design engineers and reliability engineers before permitting them on the production line. If such scrutiny \\nreveals an unnecessary or superfluous feature in the drawing, the drawings or processes should be modified \\nbut as regards the production staff are concerned, production documents mentioned above viz. working drawings, process sheets, etc. should be treated as sacrosanct.  \\n \\n5.3 Inspection and Testing   \\ni) While the function of inspection and testing organization is to carry out the actual inspection and testing, it is \\nthe function of reliability engineering service to define what these inspections and tests should be, when they \\nshould be carried out and what criteria should be followed and so on.  \\n \\nii) Organization of stage inspection from raw material  stage through components and sub-assemblies upto the \\nfinal inspection and testing of the finished product is of the utmost importance. There are many types of \\ndefects in regard to tolerances, material specification an d process parameters which will have little or no effect \\non the performance of the equipment as may be judged during acceptance tests or even limited actual service \\nbut such defects can cause even catastrophic failures in actual service. These failures may occur at any time. Some may occur within days after commissioning whereas some others may develop after several years \\nservice. It is the function of the reliability engineer to investigate all such failures to determine the real or \\nprobable causes and to alert the stage inspection organization to watch for and eliminate these types of defects.  \\n \\niii)  In this connection, special mention must be made of screening or burning-in procedures. Many \\ncomponents, particularly those which require sophisticated technology in production or those in which \\ncontamination and invisible dimensional inaccuracies can cause failures, exhibit a high rate of failure, initially. \\nThis is termed as \\'Infant mortality\\'. Examples of components which exhibit this pattern of failures are semi-conductors, fuses, incandescent lamps, coils with very fine wire etc. Reliability of such components in service \\ncan be improved by operating them at a stress level which is significantly higher than that in service. Weak \\ncomponents which would otherwise have failed in servic e will fail or at least show some deterioration of \\nproperties during the screening procedures. By elimin ating such components the re liability of the remaining \\ncomponents which survive the screening process will be much higher in actual service. It must be noted that \\n\\'screening or burning - in\\' does not improve the quality of the components. It merely accelerates the failures of those which would have failed any way in service.  \\n5.4   Operation and Maintenance  \\n \\ni) The most important contribution that can be made by operating staff and maintenance staff towards the improvement of reliability is in regard to investigat ion of failures. It is necessary to determine and  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUALVOLUME 1      [88]  \\n \\n  \\n analyze as accurately as possible the actual condi tions of service under which the failures occur \\nand to re-construct from the observed data and study of failed components the exact mechanism of \\nfailures. On the success of these studies depends the evolution of the quickest and most cost-\\neffective solutions to the problems. Experience in failure investigations is invaluable for this purpose \\nbut a systematic study and application of the principles of reliability engineering can greatly speed \\nup the investigation. A through insight into the design  of the equipment with regard to the calculation \\nof various types of stresses is of-course desirable and often essential but it is also possible to \\nevolve elegant solutions without going into the full design details.  \\n \\n6. Reliability and Cost   \\na) It is not always necessary that improvement in reliability must cost more. Better designs, different \\nmaterials, better quality control during production etc. may achieve improved reliability at little or no \\nextra cost. If scrap is reduced at the same time, the overall cost may actually come down. Predicting \\nthe cost of achieving any given reliability is nearly  always difficult, so that in general we only know \\nthe cost accurately afterwards.  \\n \\nb) Maintenance costs are also difficult to estimate. If we know precisely what repair work has to be \\ndone each time an equipment fails, then we can predict its cost.  \\n \\nHowever we are unlikely to be able to foresee associated costs such as:-  \\n \\ni) The value  of production/service lost through breakdowns.  \\n \\nii) The cost of having the equipment of action.  \\n \\n7 Suggested Books for Further Reading  \\n1.

SURVEYS \\n \\n11001 Railway Electrification Surveys  \\n \\n1. Only a brief  introduction to Railway Electrification surveys  is given in this Chapter.  \\n \\n2. Railway Electrification surveys may be classified broadly in two categories;-  \\n \\na) Cost-cum-feasibility-survey as a pre-investment investigation to assist decision making: and  \\n \\nb) Foot by foot survey to assist in preparat ion of working designs and drawings for actual \\nconstruction work.                                                                      \\n  \\nIn case of urgency it may be necessary to include por tions of (b) along with (a), but normally the two \\nsurveys are taken up separately.   \\n11002 Cost-cum-Feasibility Survey  \\n \\nIt is quick survey of the route proposed for electrific ation to examine major engineering installations \\nwhich may have a bearing on the cost of electrification.  \\n \\n1) Civil Works:  \\n \\nThis will include study of heavy overline structures  like flyovers, road over bridges, through girder \\nbridges and long deck type girder bridges and tunnels to examine whether these will require major \\nor minor modification to permit erection of ov erhead equipment. An examination of the proposed \\nremodelling plans, rack renewals, reballasting includi ng changes in the level of track, realignment of \\ncurves, all having a bearing on track geometry and the dates when these are proposed to be \\ncompleted, will be necessary.

ESTIMATES \\n \\n11004 Estimates  \\n \\nAll proposals for-  \\n \\na) The construction or purchase of ma terial for new works or assets,  \\nb) The renewal and replacement of existing works or assets,  \\nc) The scrapping, dismantlement or abandonm ent of existing works or assets,  \\nd) The repairing or reconditioning;  \\ne) Temporary and experimental works;  \\nShould be scrutinized by the authority Competent to sanction them before any expenditure or \\nliability is incurred thereon.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 1   [92] \\n Broadly estimates are of two types: -   \\n \\na) Abstract Estimates  \\nb) Detailed Estimates  \\n \\n11005 Abstract Estimates  \\n \\nAn abstract estimate is prepared in order to enable to  the authority competent to give administrative \\napproval to the expenditure of the nature and magnitude contemplated to form a reasonably \\naccurate idea to enable that authority to gauge adequately the financial prospects of the proposal. Abstract estimates avoid the expense and delay of preparing estimates for works in detail at a stage \\nwhen the necessity or the general desirability of the works proposed has not been decided upon by \\ncompetent authority. An abstract estimate should contain a brief report and justification for the work, \\nspecifications, and should mention whether funds are required in the current year and to what \\nextent. It should also show the cost subdivided under main heads and subhead or specific items, \\nthe purpose being to present a correct idea of the work and to indicate the nature of the expenditure \\ninvolved. The allocation of each item as between Capital, Development Fund, Open Line Works - Revenue, Depreciation Reserve Fund and Revenue should be indicated.   \\n11006 Detailed Estimates  \\n On receipt of administrative approval to a proj ect or scheme conveyed through the sanction to the \\nabstract estimate relating there to detailed estimate for various works should be prepared and \\nsubmitted for technical sanction of the competent  authority. It should be prepared in sufficient detail \\nto enable the competent authority to make sure that the abstract estimate sanctioned by the higher \\nauthority is not likely to be exceeded. No work included in an abstract estimate should be \\ncommenced till a detailed estimate for the same is prepared and sanctioned and adequate funds \\nare allotted by the competent authority allots adequate funds. The detailed estimate will comprise (i) \\nstatements showing details of estimated cost and (ii) an outer sheet giving the abstract of cost of \\nwork, the report, the financial justification and the allocation.  \\n \\n11007 General Rules Applicable to All Estimates  \\n \\n1. Responsibility for Preparation of Estimates   \\nFor proposals initiated in the Division estimates shall be prepared in the Division. Estimates of \\nworks, which the Senior Divisional Electrical E ngineer or the Divisional Railway Manager is not \\nempowered sanction, shall be submitted to the Chief Electrical Engineer duly verified by the \\nAccounts Officer for Administrative approval and Technical sanction.  \\n \\n2. Design and Execution  \\n \\nThe designs and execution of all new works and designs of equipment should conform to \\nIRS/RDSO Standards, Drawings, Codes, Rules, Principl es, Guidelines wherever available. No work \\nwhich infringes \"Schedules of Dimensions\" shall be executed unless prior sanction of the CRS has been obtained.  \\n \\n3. Altemative Proposals  \\n \\nWhen alternative proposals are made, separate es timate should be prepared for each, together with \\na general abstract showing in tabular form the co mparative cost of the various alternatives.  \\n \\n4. Grouping of Items  \\n \\nAs far as possible items of estimates chargeable to the same head or sub-head of account should \\nbe grouped together so that the number of items under expenditure posted in the Register of Work \\nmay be reduced to a minimum.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL -  VOLUME I    [93]  5. Grouping of Works  \\n \\na) When two or more works are so connected eit her by their situation, or by the purpose or \\npurposes which they are designed to serve, that the construction of one necessarily involves that of \\nthe other or others, the works should be considered to comprise one scheme and the aggregate \\nestimated cost of the works so connected shall determine the authority competent to sanction \\nexpenditure on the scheme.   \\nWhen the works constituting a connected scheme are situated in more than one executive division separate detailed estimates should be prepared of the cost of the work in each division so that the Engineer entrusted with the actual construction may be in a position to watch expenditure against \\nsanctioned estimate of the cost of the work in his charge.  \\n \\n6.Establishment and Other Charges  \\n \\na) It should be ensured that due provision for est ablishment charges is made in major schemes \\nunder the heading \\'Establishment\\'. If any such charges are not foreseen and additional \\nestablishment is required, sanction of the competent authority should be obtained and the expenditure shown against \\'Establishment\\' and not against \\'Contingencies\\', the excess being subsequently provided for in a revised estimate, if necessary, or explained in the completion report.   \\nb) The engagement of work-c harged establishment is  subject to the following conditions-  \\n i) The cost of establishment should be shown in detail under separate sub-heads of the estimate.  \\n \\nii) If an Engineer, Supervisor, or other staff is actually employed on the supervision of two or more \\nworks his pay and allowance should be charged proportionately to those works.      .  \\n \\nProvisions made in Indian Railway Financial Code should be kept in view in respect of various \\ncharges to be included.  \\n \\n7. Currency of Sanction  \\n \\nThe sanction to estimate shall ordinarily remain  current for 5 years from the date it has been \\naccorded, unless it has been renewed for a further term by the acceptance of a revised estimate. \\nAcceptance by competent authority, however, of a budget estimate which includes specific provision \\nfor expenditure on a work which is in progress, may be regarded as reviving for the year in which provision is made, the sanction to the estimate regardless of the five years limit. But if no work has been commenced within 2 years of the date of sanction, the sanction shall be considered as having lapsed and fresh sanction shall be obtained from the competent authority by submitting an up-to-date estimate.  \\n \\n8. Register of Estimates  \\n \\nAll estimates should, before they are submitted for accounts verification for sanction of the \\ncompetent authorities, be registered in the office of origin. For this purpose register in the following \\nform should be kept-  \\n     \\n \\n    INDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME I   [94]   \\n   \\nCHAPTER XI \\nDOCUMENTS FOR REFERENCE \\n11100 Books of Reference  \\n \\nA list of books of reference to be held at various Electrical Department offices is  appended. CEE \\nmay authorize additions to this list as required.  The Chief Electrical Engineers and Sr. Divisional  Electrical Engineers offices should be equipped \\nwith adequate number of copies of each publications. The publication should he accounted in the \\nDead Stock Register. Officials for whose personal use publications are supplied shall be responsible \\nfor their custody and handing them over pr ior to retirement from service.  \\n \\n11101 Standing Instructions  \\n \\nInstructions of a standing nature issued by the Railway Board, RDSO, CEE, Sr.DEE / DEE etc. \\nshould be filed subject-wise to be readily available for reference. An index sheet should be opened \\non the file containing a complete and up-to-date list of the standing instructions received. This file \\nshould be gone through from time to time to make ce rtain that all of them are being complied with . \\nWhen taking over charge of a post, the officer/ supervisor should study these standing instructions \\ncarefully.   \\n 11102 Drawings and Specifications  \\n \\n1. In CEE\\'s Drawing Office original tracings of drawings and copies of documents listed below \\nshould be carefully stored and preserved for reference when required: -   \\na) Specification and relevant tender and contract documents pertaining to OHE, PSI, RC and \\nRolling- Stock for the entire Railway.  \\n \\nb) Tracings or reproducible prints of design draw ings and \\' as erected\\' drawings for all Traction \\nInstallations and Rolling-Stock.   c)  Drawings and specifications for all modifications approved for Traction Installations and Rolling-Stock on the Railway.   \\nd)   One set with up-to-date corrections of all Maker\\'s Manuals and Maintenance Instructions issued \\nby RDSO etc. for Traction Installations, Rolling-Stock and important machines installed in Loco and EMU sheds, OHE depots etc.   \\n2. Officers and supervisors who have independent offices should similarly maintain drawings, \\nspecifications, Maintenance Manuals and other documents pertaining to installations and equipment \\nunder their charge. Each supervisor will be responsible for safe custody and keeping up-to-date the \\ndocuments in his charge. Sr. DEEs may nominate a supervisor attached to their offices for the \\npurpose.   \\n     \\n \\n     \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME 1    [97]  APPENDIX – I \\n \\n \\nDOCUMENTS FOR REFERENCE \\nList of Books for Reference Offices which should be equipped with copy of the publication. \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ \\nItem Publication For the     Sr. DEE AEE Traction Foreman/ TPC TLC Electrical \\nChargeman \\nNo.    Personal   DEE  Asst.

This \\nstatement should be submitted in duplicate to the higher authorities. One copy of this statement of transfer of \\ncharge between officers shall be submitted to CEE.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME  I      [104]  After taking over charge, the official concerned shall pay particular attention to the prompt clearance of \\npending items and submit a progress report at the end of three months to his superior.  \\n \\n \\n11216 Duties Defined Not Exhaustive  \\n \\nThe duties prescribed in the Manual are meant for general guidance and pertain mainly to technical aspects of \\nthe work. In common with other railwaymen, duties and responsibilities prescribed in the Establishment, \\nAccident and other Manuals are equally applicable to staff connected with electric traction.  \\n \\nII  THEFTS AND LOSSES \\n \\n11217 Responsibility for Losses  \\n \\nPara  1801 of the General Code is reproduced below:  \\n \\n\"Every public officer should exercise the same vigilance in respect of public expenditure and public funds \\ngenerally as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of the expenditure and the custody of his own money. Means should be devised to ensure that every railway servant realizes fully and clearly that he will be held personally responsible for any loss su stained by Government through fraud or negligence on \\nhis part and also for any loss arising from fraud or negligence on the part of any other railway servant to the \\nextent it may be shown that he contributed to the loss by his own action or negligence\".   11218 Thefts  \\n \\nThefts of stores or equipment pertaining to electric traction can be of the following types:   1 Thefts of OHE conductors or fittings or equipment from sub-stations, switching  stations or RCC.  2. Thefts from electric locos or EMU stock, when stabled or otherwise.  \\n3. Thefts of stores and equipment in the custody of tr action officials or from loco/EMU sheds, depots or PSI \\ndepots and offices.  \\n \\n11219 Anti-Theft Measures  \\n \\nOfficers and supervisors should constantly review the security arrangements which are in force in the various \\noffices, stores and depots under their control and endeavour  to develop ways and means of combating thefts \\nof OHE conductors, fittings and other equipment. Surprise checks should be made to make sure that locking \\nand sealing of doors of offices, stores etc. are being done properly and they are handed over to the custody of \\nSecurity staff.  \\n \\nStaff below should also be encouraged to come forward with their ideas regarding anti-theft measures and \\nshould be adequately rewarded for helpful suggestions resulting in development of such anti-theft measures. Other Divisions and Railway should also be informed of details of any device or modification found successful \\nin combating thefts.  \\n \\nParticular care should be taken in regard to the accountal and disposal of valuable components such as  \\ncopper scrap.   \\n11220 Watch on Criminal Elements  \\n \\nOfficers and Supervisors of the Electrical Department should keep themselves informed of bad characters \\namongst their staff and pass on the information in thei r possession confidentially to the Security Officer \\nconcerned. Similarly, any other information which may assist the Security Branch in apprehending criminals \\nshould also be given to the Security Officer. DRM and CEE should also be kept informed of all important \\ncases reported to the Security Department.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS   AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME I    [105] \\n 11221 Procedure to be Followed  \\n \\nIf a theft has occurred or is suspected as having taken place, the procedure to be followed is  as \\nunder:-   1 The official holding charge of the installation should make a thorough check of the stores/installation  and carry out an investigation:  \\n \\na)To check whether the procedure laid down for locking up and sealing of premises is being \\ncomplied  with.  \\n \\nb) To assess the extent of loss suffered, if any.  \\n \\nc) To take possession of relevant registers, account books and other evidence which may be of \\nassistance to the RPF and Police authorities in their investigations.  \\n \\nd) To record all the facts of the case such as the time when the theft occurred, statements of the \\nconcerned staff etc.  \\n \\n2. All cases should without  delay be reported to the Railway Police Authorities, the Security \\nDepartment and SR.DEE concerned. Complete details such as description and quantity of materials \\nlost, estimated cost, place of occurrence, time of occurrence and any other relevant particulars \\nhelpful to the investigations should be given. When the amount of loss is estimated to be over Rs \\n500, a copy of the report must invariably be sent to the Accounts Officer concerned also.  \\n \\n3. Every important case should be reported by the Sr. DEE promptly to GM(Elect) who in turn will  \\nreport the matter to the Railway Board and to the Chief Auditor through FA&CAO, if the loss \\nexceeds Rs. 5,000.  \\n \\n4. The SR.DEE should arrange for a departmental  i nquiry into every important case with the \\nassociation of the Accounts Officer concerned. The inquiry amongst other things should fix \\nresponsibility for the theft to the extent possible and submit recommendations to set over the \\nlacunae which may come to light during the investigation.  \\n \\nSuch departmental inquiries should not be delayed pending police investigation or decision of \\ncriminal cases.  \\n \\n5. Cases reported to the Railway Police should be followed up vigorously with the Police authorities \\nby Sr. DEE/AEE, with the assistance of the Security Officer.  \\n \\n6. All irrecoverable losses are required to be wri tten off with Accounts concurrence and sanction of \\nthe competent authority, in accordance with local delegation of powers.  \\n \\nThe following procedure should be followed for periodic reconciliation of losses:  \\n a) All losses, on their detection, should be entered in  a register by the officer incharge. A similar \\nregister is also required to be maintained by the Accounts and Security Officers.  \\nb) At the end of each quarter, the figures in their respective registers should be totaled up by the official in-charge, the Security Officer and the Accounts Officer.  c) The reconciled figures, duly signed by the Sr. DEE, Accounts Officer, and Security Officer will  be forwarded to CSO and FA&CAO for compiling a consolidated figure for the railway as a whole for \\nsubmission to the Railway Board. (Board\\'s letter No. 64/Sec.(CR)147/13/Pol dated 2nd August, \\n1968).  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME  I    [106]  \\n III. CARE AND CUSTODY OF INSTRUMENTS \\n11222 General  \\nThe maintenance of electrical equipment necessitates the use of variety of specialized and often \\ncostly instruments. Proper use of these instruments, their care and custody should receive special attention.   \\n11223 Distribution of Instruments  \\n \\n1.  Instruments for day-to-day use e.g. megger, cell-testing voltmeter, ordinary types of volt-meter, \\nammeter, ohm meter etc. may be issued to each section supervisor requiring such instruments, for \\ncustody. It may even be necessary to issue a few instruments for every day use to selected \\nindividual workmen.  \\n \\n2. Specialised instruments such as multi-metres, sub-standard metres, precision gauges, Ductor set \\netc. should be kept in the custody of senior supervisors only to be issued as and when required to \\nindividual sections.  \\n \\n3. Some types of special instruments such as high voltage insulation tester, sub-standard energy \\nmetres, oscilloscopes, instruments for localization of cable faults etc. should generally be kept in a \\ncentral place in each Division to be used for special tests as authorised by Sr. DEE/DEE/AEE.  \\n \\n4. Certain types of special and expensive instruments such as HV pressure testing sets may be \\nmaintained in  a common pool for a Railway as a whole.  \\n \\n5. All instruments should be borne on the \"Inventory of dead stock\" and should bear the T&P \\nnumber, either painted or punched on a metallic label securely fixed to the instruments. Periodic \\nverification of stores should he carried out as expl ained in Chapter X. A separate register should be \\nmaintained to record issues and receipts.  \\n 11224 Use of Instruments  \\n \\n1 Testing and measuring instruments are delicate equipment and should be handled with great care \\notherwise they will  get damaged and their accu racy badly impaired. These remarks apply \\nparticularly when instruments ar e being transported from one place to another; they should be taken \\nproperly packed in a wooden case with enough cushioning material.  \\n \\nCertain types of instruments e.g. CRO, Selective level meter, sub-standard and standard instruments etc. are meant only for stationary use and should not be moved outside the testing \\nlaboratory. Such instruments should be carefully stored in a cup-board and care should be taken \\nthat they are not taken out for field use.  \\n \\nOil testing sets should be permanently installed at suitable locations e.g. Central/PSI Depot, a \\nnominated room in the loco / EMU shed etc. Test samples should be taken to the depot/ shed for \\ntesting, by a trained supervisor.  \\n \\n2. Operating instructions received with special types of instruments should be carefully preserved. \\nWhen only one copy is received, additional copies  as required should be made out. One set of \\ninstructions should be kept with the instrument for day to day use and at least one more set should be kept in a central place e.g. Foreman\\'s or Sr. DEE\\'s Office. The T&P register for each item should \\nshow the distribution of copies of its operating instructions.  \\nAt least two supervisors should make a detailed study of each instruction book and be fully familiar \\nwith their use. Experience has shown that quite often a number of instruments are held which are \\nnever used in practice either because it has been handled or used by someone who is ignorant or \\nnot qualified to use it. Every supervisory official shall inspect the equipment under his control at \\nleast once in 3 months and certify that it is in good working order.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME I    [107]  Only persons who are fully familiar with all th e details should be permitted to handle and use the \\ninstruments, especially the expensive specialized instruments. Amateurish handling.of instruments, even comparatively simple instruments such as Avo-meters, can result in serious damage to them.  \\n \\n \\n4. Instruments meant for field use should invariably have suitable carrying cases. Even if such \\ncarrying cases are not received with  the instru ments, they should be got manufactured to ensure \\nthat the instruments do not get damaged due to careless transporting.  \\n \\n11225 Periodic Calibration and Repair of Instruments  \\n \\n1. Each Zonal Railway should have a qualified supervisor and a few specially skilled and trained men, attached to the Central PSI Depot or other conv enient place, for carrying out simple repairs of \\ncommon instruments such as ammeters, volt-meters, ohm-.meters, pressure gauges etc. The repair \\nsection should be equipped with special tools like  watchmaker\\'s hand tools, watchmaker\\'s lathe, \\nwinding machine for small coils, testing instruments of sub-standard accuracy, test bench with \\nvariable voltage and current supply etc.  \\n \\n2.  Special instruments should as far as possibl e be got repaired by the makers or their authorized \\nrepresentatives. When these are not available, care should be taken to entrust such repairs only to \\nreliable firms specializing in such jobs and having adequate facilities for repair and testing.  \\n \\n3.   Standard and sub-standard meters, gauges etc. should be got tested once in two years by recognized laboratories and test certificates obtained.  A copy of the test certificate should be placed \\nin a plastic envelope and kept along with the instrument, while the original should be carefully filed.    \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME –I    [108]  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                 CHAPTER I  \\n    POWER  SUPPLY  FOR TRACTION   \\n \\n20100  Supply System  \\n1. The single phase 50 Hz. Power for the electric traction is obtained from 220/132/110/66 KV \\nExtra High Voltage 3 -phase grid system through step do wn single -phase transformers.  For this \\npurpose duplicate feeders comprising of only 2 phases are run from the nearest grid substation of \\nthe Supply Authority to the traction substation.  The brief description of the system is given in \\nChapter 2 of Volume I.  The 25 KV single phase conventional system as adopted on Indian \\nRailways has been described in that chapter.  A schematic diagram of the traction sub station and \\nfeeding post indicating the general feeding arrangement is indicated at Fig. 1.01.  \\n \\nSalien t technical features of the 2x25KV AutoTransformer (AT) feed system are indicated in Chapter XI.  \\n \\n20101  Liasion with Power Supply Authorities . \\n \\nFor ensuring continuity and reliability of power supply for traction it is important that effective liaison \\nis maintained between the officials of Railway and Supply Authorities.  Broadly action on the \\nfollowing lines be taken:  \\n \\na) A system of periodic meetings at different levels at mutually agreed intervals needs to be \\nevolved.  \\n \\nb) Reliability of supply involves also t he maintenance of traction voltage between 25 KV and 27.5 \\nKV at the feeding posts and frequency between 48.5Hz. and 51.5 Hz.  The serious repercussions \\non Railway traffic if the above limits are not adhered to should be constantly impressed upon the \\nSupply  Authorities.  \\nc) The traction load should be treated as essential load and should not be disconnected or reduced \\nto meet supply system exigencies.  This principle has been accepted by most Supply Authorities \\nand where this has not been done, constant efforts should be made at the high level periodic \\nmeetings to get this principle accepted.  \\nd) Since the cumulative effect of frequent power supply interruptions, even though of short duration \\nat a time, can be very serious to Railway working, a periodical review of a ll such interruptions should \\nbe made at the Divisional level and the cause of each interruption ascertained as far as possible.  \\nThe results of the review should be furnished to CEE to keep him fully informed of the power supply \\nposition.  This subject sho uld also form an important item for discussion at the periodic meetings \\nwith the Supply Authorities.  \\n \\ne) Power supply for electric traction should be governed by a specific Agreement entered into by \\nthe Railway with the concerned Supply Authority before the s upply is actually taken.  Where this has \\nnot been done already, urgent action should be taken to have it finalized without delay.  \\n \\nf) When grid supply to any traction sub -station fails and consequently emergency working has to \\nbe resorted to by extending the feed from adjacent sub -stations, the maximum demand at these \\nsub-stations may go up.  Most  Supply Authorities have agreed to ignore such temporary increase in \\nmaximum demand for billing purposes.  Where this has not yet been agreed to, efforts should be \\ncontinued to persuade the Supply Authorities to accept this principle.  \\n \\ng) The present methodology of measuring maximum demand at each individual sub -stations for \\nthe purpose of billing has been reviewed by the Central Electricity Authority.  It has been agree d that \\nRailways should be charged for traction power on the basis of simultaneous maximum demand \\nrecorded in contiguous sub -stations of the SEB serviced by the same grid transformers.  Modalities \\nto implement the decision would have to be mutually settled between SEBs and Railways, with cost \\nof the equipment borne by Railways.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME II PART I       (3)  \\n \\n 20102  Tariff for Traction  \\n \\na) In Electric Traction the energy cost forms a substantial por tion of the total operating and \\nmaintenance cost.  The tariffs charged by various state Electricity Boards vary from a simple flat \\nrate for the energy (charged by some states like MSEB & GEB) to a very complex tariff structure \\ncovering a variety of paramet ers (as indicated in the tariff charged by MPEB).  The implications of \\nthe various parameters should be studied carefully to keep the energy cost to the minimum possible \\nlevel.  \\n \\nb) Contract demand for each sub -station should be stipulated in relation to the e xpected actual \\nMaximum Demand in such a manner that in fructuous payments by way of minimum guarantee on \\nthe one hand and penal charges for exceeding the contract demand on the other, are avoided.  \\nNotice period for altering Contract Demand should also be kept as low as possible in the \\nagreement, preferably 4 to 6 weeks.  \\n \\nc) In the tariff charged for electric traction, following are some of the parameters that should be \\ngiven careful consideration with a view to keeping down the energy bill to the minimum.  \\n \\n \\ni)  Maximum demand charge Rs/KVA/month :  Normally one feeder is “ON” for feeding the traction \\nload.  If two sets of trivector meters are provided, the higher of the two should be the MD to be \\ncharged.  Caution may be exercised to ensure that addition of both is not taken as MD in billing.  \\n \\nii) Energy charge Paise/Kwh  \\n \\niii) Fuel Adjustment Charge (FAC) accounting for the variations in cost of fuel and calorific value \\ncompared to stipulated basis figures.  This charge should be realistic and should be periodically \\nverifi ed with the Supply Authorities.  \\n \\niv) Penalty for low power factor :  The penal charge is prescribed as an extra amount livable in \\nRs/KVA of Maximum Demand if power factor falls below a specified value.  SEBs usually insist on \\nconsumer providing PF correcting e quipment and do not permit power factor lower than a \\nprescribed value.  \\n \\nv) Billing Demand is usually a certain percentage of contract demand or the actual MD \\nwhichever is higher.  \\n \\nvi) Excess over Contract Demand and corresponding units of energy are usually charg ed at \\nhigher tariff (excluding FAC).  Even if the excess MD is for a short period of just 15 min. \\nproportionate units for the entire month are charged at penal rate.  One of the SEBs does \\ncomputation of excess energy as under:  \\n \\nExcess Energy                    =    TU (1 -CD/MD)  \\nWhere TU                           =  Total Energy  \\nMD                                      =   Maximum Demand  \\nCD                                       =  Contract Demand  \\nThe Contract demand therefore, has to be carefully determined, and reviewed periodically and if \\nnecessary modified to avoid penal charges.  \\n \\nvii) Minimum Guarantee  \\n \\nUsually, the agreement with SEB stipulate a percentage of 15 to 20% on the capital cost invested by \\nthe SEB for giving the connection, as minimum guarantee.  Th is is generally met by the pattern of \\nenergy consumption in traction.  However, minimum guarantee in some cases is specified in terms \\nof guaranteed average load factor (say 30%).  This ties up the Contract Demand with the units \\nconsumed.                                                                                    [5]  If a few heavy trains operate in a section raising the Maximum Demand high, the average load \\nfactor may not reach 30% unless adequate frequency of passenger trains also forms part of the  \\ntraffic pattern.  Here, if contract demand is too high, 30% load factor is difficult to achieve while if \\ncontract demand is too low, exceeding it and attracting penal changes becomes a possibility.  \\nCareful balance between the two conflicting requirements  has, therefore, to be struck.  \\n \\nviii) Harmonic Voltage Distortion  \\n \\nThe consumer is required to carry out Harmonic Analysis under full load conditions.  It is  stipulated \\nthat the individual harmonic voltage distortion (Vn) at the point of supply shall not exceed  1% and \\n3% respectively.  \\n \\nV  - RMS value of fundamental voltage.  \\n \\nVn – RMS value of harmonic voltage of order “n” , expressed as percentage of RMS value of the \\nfundamental and shall be calculated using the following expression:  \\n           [(V2)2+(V3)2+(V4)2+---+(V13)2] 1/2  x 100  \\nVt =                             V  \\n \\nd)  The tariff charged for traction should be reviewed periodically with the SEB, it should be ensured    \\nthat the rates do not exceed those charged in EHV tariff of the SEB applicable to other c onsumers.  \\n \\n20103  Monthly Meter Readings  \\n \\na) In earlier Railway Electrification installations, only one set of meters owned by the Supply \\nAuthorities has been installed to meter the traction load.  In later installations, a second set of \\nmeters is being provi ded on the sub -station switchboard at Railways cost.  Where only one set of \\nmeters belonging to the supply authority is installed yearly testing of the meter should be carried \\nout.  If its accuracy is in doubt at any point of time, the Railway is entitled to ask for testing and \\ncertification of the meter.  Where a second set of meters has been provided at Railways cost, the \\nfigures for billing purposes should ordinarily be based on the average readings of the two sets of \\nmeters, unless specifically provided  for otherwise in the Agreement.  The exact procedure covering \\nthese aspects should be embodied in the Agreement with the Supply Authorities.  \\n \\nb) The monthly meter readings should be taken on an agreed date each month jointly be \\nrepresentatives of the Supply Authority and the Railway.  The meter card as well as the \\nprintomaxigraph chart reading showing the maximum demand for the month should be initialed by \\nrepresentatives of both parties.  Only readings jointly recorded as above should be accepted for \\nbilling  purposes.  \\n \\nc) When visiting the grid sub -stations for taking meter readings, the supervisory official concerned \\nwill also obtain additional information such as daily maximum demand for traction, power factor, \\nload factor, variation of voltage, changes in the  system of interconnection, which have a bearing on \\npower supply for traction.  Suggestions for suitable changes in the Supply Authority’s network may \\nbe made at appropriate level and if necessary concrete proposals initiated  for making power supply \\n100% reliable.  \\n \\n20104  Scrutiny of Bills  \\n \\na) The Supply Authorities bills should be carefully scrutinized in the Divisional Office with reference \\nto the Agreement and the tariff.  A time schedule should be laid down jointly with the Accounts \\nDepartment for scrutin y and passing of the bill so as to take advantage of the rebate admissible, if \\nany, for prompt payment.  Panel charges levied, if any, should be carefully scrutinized and \\nappropriate remedial measures  \\n[6] \\n taken to prevent recurrence.  If the minimum charg e payable is in excess of the amount warranted \\nby the actual energy consumption, this fact should be promptly brought to the notice of CEE as well \\nas the operating Department to take special steps to arrange for movement of additional traffic, to \\nthe exten t possible, in the affected section, including diversion from other routes.  \\n \\nb) Detailed instructions should be issued locally, jointly with the Accounts Department, listing the \\nitems to be checked prior to passing the bills from the Supply Authorities.  An i llustrative list is given \\nbelow:  \\ni)    Arithmetical accuracy  \\nii) Meter readings shown on the bill tally with those received earlier from the subordinates.  \\niii) The tariff applied is in terms of the agreement.  \\niv) The method of computation of the maximum demand for billing  purpose is in accordance \\nwith the agreement and that temporary increase in maximum demand on account of \\nemergency feeding has not been taken into account where this principle has been accepted.  \\n \\nv) The time allowed for payment is in accordance with the agree ment.  \\nvi) There is no duplication in billing.  \\n \\nvii) The payee as provided for in the agreement is clearly indicated.  The full particulars of the \\npayee should be advised to the Accounts branch to enable that Branch to issue cheques \\naccordingly.  \\n \\nviii) Each new bill shoul d be analyzed and compared with earlier bill and the reasons for any \\nsignificant departures investigated.  \\n \\nIn case of any dispute/discrepancy, the payment be made “under protest”  \\n \\n20105   Power Factor Improvement  \\n \\na) Provision of power factor improvement capa citors at 25 KV bus of traction substations should be \\nplanned giving priority to substations (I)  which feed large marshalling yards and (ii) where penalty \\nfor low power factor and / or exceeding maximum demand has been stipulated in the tariff.  \\n \\nb) The avera ge monthly power factor is calculated as ratio of KWh and KVAh over a month.  Care \\nshould be taken to make sure that it does not go ‘leading’ while P.F. correcting equipment is used \\nand is kept near unity.  Switched capacitor be used where load violations are wide.  \\n \\nc) The Guidelines issued by RDSO in respect of selection of the KVAr rating should be kept in view \\nat the time of planning.  \\n \\n20106  Shut -Downs of Traction Supply to be Pre -planned  \\n \\na) At all grid sub -stations and traction sub -stations owned by the rai lways, duplicate EHV feeders \\nare available.  Most of the sub -stations also have two sets of traction power transformers and \\nassociated switchgear.  Maintenance of equipment and transmission lines should not, therefore, \\nnecessitate total shut -down of EHV an d 25 Kv supply at a sub -station.  It should be arranged with \\nthe Supply Authorities that on the rare occasions when such shut -down becomes inescapable, \\nnotice should be given well in advance to Sr. DEE/DEE(TRD) stating the reasons for the shut -down \\nand the  anticipated duration.  Such shut -downs should be arranged by Sr. DEE/DEE (TRD) in \\nconsultation with the Operating Department which may have to re -schedule trains and take a other \\nmeasures as necessary.  \\n \\nb) A double circuit set of transmission lines from the Grid sub -station are run to give supply to \\ntraction sub -station.  Therefore, maintenance of the transmission line does not necessitates total \\nshut-down of                                        [7] the systems.  However, all such shut -downs should be plann ed well in advance giving the reasons \\nfor the shut -down and anticipated duration.  \\n20107  Operating instructions for Grid Sub -stations  \\nDetailed operating instructions mutually agreed to between the Supply Authorities and the Railway \\nshould be made out for e ach grid sub -station as well as traction sub -station owned by the Railway \\nand should be issued to TPC as well as operators at grid stations.  These instructions should \\ncontain the following details.  \\n \\na) Procedure for carrying out switching operations at the s ub-station.  \\n \\nb) Procedure for interchange of message of pre -planned or emergency shut downs.  \\n \\nc) Procedure to be followed in case of failure of supply and information to be  conveyed by grid \\nsub-station operator regarding duration of failure and anticipated time  of restoration to enable \\nemergency working to be introduced.  \\n \\nd) Records to be maintained by grid sub -station operator and TPC regarding emergency feed \\narrangements.  \\n \\ne) List of office and residential telephone numbers of important grid and railway officials to  be \\ncontact in an emergency.  \\n \\nf) Mutual assistance to be rendered for transmission of important messages in the event of \\ntelephone failures at the grid sub -stations or RCC.  \\n \\n20108  Statistical Data Regarding Energy Consumption  \\n \\nIn the divisional office, al re gister should be maintained to record month wise the following \\nparticulars in regard to energy consumption at each supply point: - \\n \\na) Energy consumption (Kwh)  \\nb) Maximum demand (Kva)  \\nc) Average power factor (KWH/KVAH)  \\nd) Monthly average load factor per cent  \\ne) Payment fo r energy  \\nf) Payment for maximum demand  \\ng) Payment towards meter rent  \\nh) Payment of fuel surcharges, if any  \\ni) Payment for P.F. surcharge/penal charge  \\nj) Payment of covering the minimum guarantee load, if any  \\nk) Other payments, if any  \\nl) Total amount of bill under all heads  \\n \\nm) Average total cost per Kwh.  \\nA consolidated statement giving the above details for all supply points should be furnished by Sr. \\nDEE/TRD to CEE each month by a stipulated date.  CEE will in turn furnish a monthly statement in \\nthe prescribed Performa to the Rai lway Board and Research Design and Standards Organization \\n(RDSO).                                                                 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[8]  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Monthly Maintenance  \\n \\n20227    Bonding and Earthing  \\n20228    Oil level in transformers, CBs and CTs etc.  \\n20229    Insulators  \\n20230    Traction Transformers  \\n20231    Operating Mechanism of Circuit Breakers & Interruptors  \\n20232    Isolators  \\n20233    Bus bar, Clamps and connectors  \\n20234    Control and Relay Panels  \\n \\nQuarterly Maintenance  \\n \\n20235    Batteries and Battery Charger  \\n20236    PTs & CTs  \\n20237    Booster Transformers  \\n20238    Auxiliary Transformers  \\n \\nHalf Yearly Maintenance  \\n \\n20239    Gene ral \\n20240    Traction Transformers  \\n20241    Isolators  \\n20242    Control and Relay Panels  \\n \\n  \\nYearly Maintenance  \\n \\n20243    General  \\n20244    Lightning Arrestors  \\n20245    Bonding and Earthing  \\n20246    Traction Transformers  \\n20247    Isolators  \\n20248    Bus bars and Connec tors \\n20249    Control and Relay Panels  \\n20250    Batteries and Battery Chargers  \\n20251    PTs and CTs  \\n20252  Special Maintenance Schedules for Minimum Oil Circuit Breakers and Interruptors  \\n20253    Pre-monsoon Checks  \\n20254    Overhaul Schedule for Equipment  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[10] \\n                                                         CHAPTER II     \\n                            SUB -STATIONS AND SWITCHING STAITONS   \\n \\n \\n20200   Introduction  \\n \\n1.

ORGANISATION  \\n \\n20201  Organizational Set up  \\n \\nThe Divisional set up of senior subordinates working under Sr. DEE/TRD has been arranged on two \\ntypes of patterns.  \\n \\na) Territorial basis  \\n \\nb) Functional basis  \\n \\nIn the territorial set up one Sr.  Subordinate is responsible for all the activities of maintenance and \\noperation over a predetermined section of electrified territory or a sub -division.  The functional set \\nup envisages separate Sr./ Subordinate to be incharge of each activity viz.. sub -station.  OHE, \\nworkshop, PSI etc. in a division or sub -division.  Duties , however, have been specified here in \\nrelation to particular function.  For territorial set up, the CTFO incharge will perform his duties \\nkeeping all functions in view, the next in com mand viz. TFO being the functional incharge of the \\nspecific activity.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[11] Remote Control system or protective relay testing being a specialized activity, CTFO (RC) and \\nCTFO/Test Room usually have a functional jurisdiction over the entire division, wi th Head Quarters \\nat the Remote Control Centre and Divisional Repair Shop respectively.  The CTFOs in territorial \\ncharge, should keep a constant liaison between themselves since these aspects will have an \\nelement of dual control.  \\n \\n20202  Duties of Chief Tra ction Foreman, Power Supply Installation  \\nHe is the senior supervisor working under the control of DEE/AEE/TRD and directly responsible for \\nthe safe and efficient operation and maintenance of traction power supply installations including \\nsub-stations (when owned by the railway), switching stations, booster transformers and auxiliary \\ntransformers in his jurisdiction.  He shall be thoroughly conversant with all technical details of the \\nequipment under his charge including their rating, trend of power demand as  also correct methods \\nof their operation and maintenance, in particular, he shall  \\n \\n1. supervise the maintenance of installations under his charge in accordance with the \\nprescribed schedules to keep them fully serviceable at all times and in a state of good re pair: \\n \\n2. maintain proper co -ordination with the Traction Power Controller, Chief Traction Foreman \\n(OHE), Supply Authorities and render assistance when required to ensure reliability of power \\nsupply:  \\n \\n3. keep his organistion in constant readiness to deal promptl y with any breakdowns and \\nfailures of equipment;  \\n \\n4. ensure that the programme of testing and maintenance of protective relays is adhered to and \\nensure that other safety equipment including bonding and earthing are functioning effectively;  \\n \\n5. instruct, train an d supervise staff under his control and ensure that they do operate and \\nmaintain the equipment properly and in particular do actually observe all rules and regulations and \\nsafety precautions laid down;  \\n \\n6. depute staff for refresher courses as prescribed, par ticularly for such staff as are found \\ndeficient in their working;  \\n \\n7. ensure that special instruments and tools provided for maintenance operation and testing of \\nall installations are properly cared for;  \\n \\n8. keep a close watch on availability of spare parts and other stores required for maintenance \\nand operation of the installations and initiate timely action to recoup stocks;  \\n \\n9. ensure proper accountal and periodical verification of stores and tools in his charge.  \\n \\n10. Depute staff when required to man sub -stations an d switching stations in the event of failure \\nof remote control equipment.  \\n \\n11. Inspect all installations under his charge at least once a month, with particular attention to \\nsafety aspects;  \\n \\n12. Submit prescribed periodical returns after careful scrutiny to AEE/TR D and Sr. \\nDEE/DEE(TRD);  \\n \\n13. Keep his superior officers fully informed of all important development and seek their \\nguidance when required;  \\n \\n14. Carry out such other duties as may be allotted by superior officers from time to time.  \\n15. Carry out inspections as indicate d at Annexure 2.01.      [12]                                        II  OPERATION OF SUB -STATIONS  \\n20203  Introduction  \\n \\nSince the electric traction system depends upon continuous availability of power supply, sub -\\nstations and switching stations have to be kept in proper working condition at all the time.  To \\nensure this, the transmission lines, the 25 KV feeder lines and traction transformers with associated \\nswitch gear and control and relay panels are duplicated so that if one unit fails, the standby unit can \\nbe brought into service to continue power supply.  All switching operations are also centralized and \\ncontrolled by remote operation by a single authority, namely Traction Power Controller.  \\n \\n20204  Inspection Book and Log Book at Sub -Stations  \\n \\nAn “inspe ction Book” shall be maintained at every sub -station in which observations made by \\nsupervisory officials visiting the sub -station for periodical inspections shall be recorded.  In addition \\na log book should also be maintained to keep a record of the tracti on transformer oil temperature, \\nambient temperature as well as currents and voltages as indicated on the control panel at a fixed \\ntime every morning.  If there is any thing abnormal unusual, CTFO/PSI will investigate the cause \\nthoroughly and take necessary  remedial action.  \\n \\n20205  Overload Capacity of Traction Transformers  \\n \\nTraction transformers usually have the following overload capacity:  \\n \\n1. Overload rating : (a) 50% overload for 15 min. and (b) 100% overload for a period of 5 min.: \\nafter the transformer ha s attained steady temperature on continuous operation at full load.  \\n \\n2. Over an ambient temperature of 45 degree C the maximum permissible temperature rise \\nshall be as under:  \\n \\n(a)   Winding    =  50degree C (by resistance method)  \\n(b)  Oil    =  40 degree C ( by thermometer)  \\n(c )  Current carrying parts  = 35   degree C ( BY THERMOMETER)  \\n \\n3. The hot -spot temperature after 50 % overload for 15 min, or 100% overload for 5 min. shall \\nnot exceed 100 degree C for an ambient temperature of 45 degree C.  \\n \\n4. Interval of time permissible between two successive overloads ( after continuous working at \\nmaximum ambient temperature of 45 degree C is 3 hours for both 50% overload for 15 min. and \\n100% overload for 5 min.  \\n \\n20206  Tap Setting on Traction Transformers  \\n \\nTraction Transform ers are usually provided with off -load tap changers ( operated locally or by \\nremote control ) with taps from + 10% to ( -)  15% in steps of 5%.  To decide the correct tap setting a \\nrecording voltmeter should be connected at the traction sub -station to the s econdary side of a \\npotential transformer to ascertain the pattern of voltage variation throughout the 24 hours for atleast \\n3 typical days.  Based on the readings from the recording the tap position should be fixed so that the \\ndaily OHE voltage peaks at the  traction sub -station lie just below 27.5 KV but does not touch 27.5 \\nKV.  This will ensure that the OHE voltage is well above the minimum of 19 KV at the farthest point \\non the system even when heavily loaded.  Once a year a 24 hours record of voltages avai lable on \\nthe two sides of every neutral section should be taken to make sure that the voltage does not fall \\nbelow 19 KV at any time.  \\n \\nSince any change in the inter -connections of the grid system would have repercussions on the \\nvoltage at the traction sub -station, the CTFO/PSI should keep in touch with the supply authorities in \\nregard to system changes           [13] so that he may arrange to take another set of 24 hour voltage readings if any change has taken \\nplace and to change the tap setting if required.  \\n \\n20207  Tests on Transformer Oil  \\nIn order to improve the performance and to prolong the life of the transformers, EHV grade oil is \\nused.  The following two specifications the first one for new oil and the second for oil in service, are \\nadopted.  \\n \\n(a)  IS - 335  Specification for New Insulating Oils.  \\n(b)  IS - 1866   Code of practice for maintenance and supervision of insulating oil in  \\n      service.  \\nA summary of tests for various characteristics, the requirements to be complied with and methods of \\ntests as co ntained in the two specifications is at Annexure 2.03 (A&B).  The tests are wide ranging \\nand should be done once a year.  However, some of the tests like Breakdown voltage (BDV) test, \\nacidity tests, crackle test for moisture, may be carried out in PSI depo ts or sub -stations once in six \\nmonths when samples are drawn for condition monitoring as per para 20216  Procedures for these \\ntest are indicated in IS 1866.  \\n \\n20208  Purification of Transformer Oil  \\nThe object of oil purification is to remove all contaminant s such as water, carbon deposits, dirt, \\nsludge, dissolved moisture and gases.  The most important quality to be preserved is the di -electric \\nstrength, which is affected by the presence of moisture.  \\n \\nThe insulating materials used in the winding are hydrosco pic by nature and therefore moisture is \\nabsorbed through defective breathers, gaskets and addition of untreated make up oil.  It is essential \\nto remove these impurities by purifying the oil when the di -electric strength goes below the \\npermissible limits.  \\n \\n20209  Oil Purification Plant  \\nFor purifying the transformer oil, machines conforming to RDSO’s Specification No. ETI/PSI/103 \\nmay be used.  These are normally operated from 240 V single phase supply taken from the 100 \\nKVA Station transformer provided at the  sub-station.  Supervisory officials in charge of maintenance \\nof transformers should make themselves familiar with the supplier’s instructions in regard to the \\noperation and maintenance of the oil purifying equipment.  \\n \\n20210  Insulation Resistance During D rying Out  \\nReadings of temperature and insulation resistance should be recorded every two hours, from \\ncommencement until the full operation is completed.  If the readings are plotted on a graph, the \\nappearance will be as shown in Fig. 2.01.  \\n \\nIt will be obse rved that there are four distinct stages:  \\n \\nA. Initially the insulation resistance drops down to a low value because of rise in temperature of \\nthe oil upto about 75 degree C.  \\n \\nB. Insulation resistance will continue to remain at a low level despite temperature bei ng \\nmaintained at a high level until most of the moisture from the windings and oil has been driven out.  \\n \\nC. The insulation resistance will thereafter rise gradually and level off, indicating that all \\nmoisture has been driven out and the drying out operation h as been completed.  At this point oil \\ncirculation should be discontinued.  \\n \\nD. As the oil cools off, the insulation resistance will rise much above the leveling off point at the \\nend of stage ©.  This is because the insulation resistance value doubles for a fal l in temperature of \\nabout 10 degree C to 15 degree C.  \\n[14]   \\n transformer may have to be pressed into service for the duration of the peak load.  Such parallel \\noperation of traction transformers may sometimes also incidentally  resu lt in reduction of the total \\nlosses thereby effecting economy.  Secondly, it will also result in higher OHE voltage, since traction \\ntransformer impedance is now halved as the transformers are identical.  \\n \\nIf a sub -station is persistently overloaded and an a djacent sub -station is appreciably underloaded, \\nthe possibility of shifting the neutral section may be considered.  \\n \\n20213  Operation of Differential Protection  \\n \\nApart from operation on account of internal faults in the transformer, the differential relay c ould also \\noperate either because of current in -rush on account of magnetization of the core at the time of \\nswitching on or because of spill current caused by lack of perfect balance between secondaries of \\nEHV and 25 KV current transformers.  The causes for  such  mal -operation may be defective \\nharmonic restraint filters or wrong CT ratios and should be eliminated.  \\n \\n20214  Buchholz Relay  \\n \\nThe Buchholz relay assembly is provided on transformers to detect evolution of gas caused due to \\ninternal faults.  After f irst commissioning, the upper assembly of the relay may sometimes be found \\nto operate causing the relay to trip.  Analysis of the composition of gas collected will indicate the \\nnature of fault.  If it is mere air bubbles the transformer is sound.  For deta ils of tests manufacturers \\nwrite up may be referred to.  It is always a wise policy to get the de -electric strength of the oil tests, \\nmeasure the insulation resistance and carry out ratio test.  \\n \\nIII  Guiding Notes On Maintenance  \\n20215  Introduction  \\n \\n1. For be tter utilization of traction assets, outage of any traction equipment from service should \\nbe minimum without compromising on safety of the equipment and personnel.  Monitoring of \\ncondition of the equipment by reliable means is essential for following syste m of need based \\nmaintenance i.e. directed maintenance. However, till such time reliable condition monitoring \\ntechniques are introduced, the present system of preventive maintenance has to continue.  \\n2. Recommendations of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) a nd guidelines issued by \\nRDSO, time to time, shall be kept in view while defining the scope and periodicity of the schedules.  \\n3. The tightening torque for fasteners of various sizes is given in Annexure 2.08.  \\n \\n20216  Transformers  \\n \\n1. Condition Monitoring  \\nIn oil filled equipment like transformers, normal deterioration or ageing of insulation is caused by \\nthermo -chemical reaction with participation of heat, moisture and oxygen.  This results in formation \\nof soluble and insoluble products which accumulate and deteri orate the properties of oil and \\ncellulosic insulation.  Whereas the oil can be reconditioned to restore functional properties, no such \\ntreatment is possible for the cellulosic insulation, which suffers from reduction of mechanical and di -\\nelectric strength.   The condition of the insulation, therefore, needs to be checked by suitable \\nmethods.  \\n \\nThe thermal and electrical stresses caused during short circuits, overloads and over voltages in the \\nsystem result is gas formation in appreciable amount and deteriorat ion of di -electric properties and \\nlowering of flash point of oil from 145 degree C to somewhere between 50 degree to 80 degree C in \\nextreme cases.  In the case of incipient faults, the gases being soluble, are absorbed in oil.  The \\nBuchholz relay cannot re spond during early stages of trouble and by the time these devices operate \\nthe damage is done.  Dissolved gas analysis (DGA_ provides an important means in the art of \\ncondition monitoring of power transformers and other oil filled equipment.  Of the variou s methods of \\ngas                  [16] analysis Gas Chromatography (GS ) is one of the most sensitive, efficient and rapid method, \\neminently suited for detection of incipient faults and for monitoring of growing faults which are not \\nalways revealed by esta blished routine tests etc.  In order to timely detect the deterioration of \\ninsulation, oil sample shall be drawn annually and subjected to gas chromatography.  \\n \\nGuidelines for condition monitoring of traction transformers by Dissolved Gas Analysis technique  \\nare appended at Annexure 2.04.  \\n \\n2.  Overhaul Of Transformers.    \\na) Overhaul of a transformer is normally undertaken either if it is faulty or at the end of 7 -10 \\nyears by way of periodic maintenance.  This can be done in the Central Repair Shop which is a \\ncovered shop having full facilities including a core lifting bay with a crane.  Before commencing the \\nwork ensure that spare gaskets of proper quality are available.  Drain out the oil, disconnect at \\nleads, remove manhole covers where required.  The EHV and 25 KV bushings are then carefully \\nremoved out and stored well protected in a safe place.  Then remove the core by means of the \\nlifting hooks and place on shop floor over a trestle in a large receptacle into which oil can drain out.  \\nb) If the transformer has b een opened up because of any internal fault, make a careful note of \\ncolour of transformer oil, arc -marks, carbon deposits, charring of insulation, condition of the \\nwindings, unusual odour and other abnormalities which would all help in ascertaining the cau se of \\nthe failure.  If a coil has been burnt out, the whole transformer will have to be completely dismantled \\nand then the damaged coil replaced with a new coil.  In the case of the traction transformer, the \\nreplacement of the damaged coil is best done in the manufactuer’s works where necessary facilities \\nand staff with the requisite skill are available.  \\nc) Arrange for the interior of the transformer tank to be thoroughly cleaned of all accumulated \\ndebris, sludge, etc. and wash with fresh oil.  Remove the drai n plug, lightly polish the valve seat and \\nrenew the oil -tight gasket round the spindle so that when assembled the plug is fully oil tight;  the \\nsame remarks apply to the oil sampling valve, if provided.  Opportunity should also be taken to plug \\nor weld up any small blow holes through which oil seepage was observed earlier.  Finally paint the \\nexterior of the tank if necessary after thoroughly cleaning it up of all paint work, rust and traces of oil \\nand dirt.  \\nd) If the coil assembly is lifted up after 5,. 10 or more years of service, considerable amount of \\nsludge formation would have occurred on all parts of the transformer i.e. at the bottom of the tanks, \\nmetal work of the transformers, windings and inter -spaces between windings.  All these should be \\nscrapped of f carefully with a wooden or fiber wedge without causing any damage to the windings.  \\nTraces of the sludge left over in inaccessible places are best removed by directing a thin jet of \\ntransformer oil under pressure using small oil purifier.  At the same ti me the old surface \\ncontamination should be brushed and washed down, until the clear surface of the winding is \\nexposed.  \\n \\ne) Care should be taken to protect the windings against ingress of moisture particularly during \\ninclement weather.  Care should also be tak en by wiping off body sweat with a towel.  The windings \\nshould also be kept warm by surrounding the open windings by a number of infra -red lamps or by \\nother means.  \\n \\nf) Fully push home the wedges between the coils and take up the slackness of end -plates by \\ntightening up the bolts and locking them.  These are provided on traction transformers to hold the \\nwindings tightly together to withstand the high mechanical forces generated at the time of short \\ncircuits.  Shrinkage and settlement usually take place within t he first six months of the \\ncommissioning of a transformer.  The coils are also liable to suffer displacement due to short circuit \\nforces.  If the coils are not held tightly in position, it will lead to repeated movement of the coils as \\nwell as layers and t urns which will in turn cause abrasion and wear of insulation and ultimately \\nfailure.  It is, therefore, sometimes recommended that the first available opportunity should be taken \\nto have the wedges fully home and tighten up the pressure screws where they are provided.  \\n \\n[17] \\n g) Finally put back the core assembly inside the tank, assembly the bushing check tightness of \\nall internal connections, fit the top, provide new gaskets, fill pure oil and dry out as detailed in para \\n20208 to 20210.  Experience has show n that tools like spanners and foreign objects like washers, \\npieces of cloth, etc. are sometimes inadvertently left behind in the transformers, which present \\nhazard of short circuits.  It is, therefore, important that al tools, etc. used in the overhaul wo rk should \\nbe listed out at the beginning and accounted for at the end of the work.  \\n \\nWhen overhauled transformers are to commissioned the same procedure as detailed in Chapter IX \\nfor new transformers should be followed;  \\n \\nEach railway should plan, taking int o consideration the resources available with them to carry out \\nthe POH and repairs of the transformer and decide the agency to execute the work.  \\n \\n2. Investigation into causes of Failures of Transformers.  \\n \\nIn most cases the causes of the fault can be surmised by careful observation of the condition the \\nwindings, e.g. displacement of the turns or coils, coil insulation (brittle or healthy), evidence of \\noverheating carbon deposit or flash marks on the core, supports, the inner surface of the tank or \\ncover.  The f ollowing notes may be of help in identifying the cause.  \\n \\na) Failure due to lightning discharge or overvoltages -  This is characterized by breakdown of \\nthe end turns close to the line terminal.   There may be a break in the turns or end lead, and also \\nflash m arks on the end coil and earthed parts close to it, but the rest of the coils will be found to be \\nhealthy.  \\n \\nb) Sustained overloads – The windings in one or all phases would show sings of overheating \\nand charring; the insulation would be very brittle and would  have lost all its elasticity.  \\n \\nc) Inter-turn short, inter -layer short, or inter -coils short -  The same signs as for indicated for \\nsustained over load would be noticed, but only on affected coils, the rest of the coils being intact.  \\nThis is likely if the di fferential relay or the Buchholz relay has operated.  \\n \\nd) Dead short circuit – This can be identified by the unmistakable, lateral or axial displacement \\nof the coils.  The coils may be loose on the core, some turns on the outermost layer may have burst \\noutward s and broken as if under tension.  If, in addition to these signs, the windings are also \\ncompletely  charred, it is conclusive evidence that the short circuit has continued for an appreciable \\nperiod, not having been cleared quickly by the protective relays . \\n \\ne) If the upper chamber of the Buchholz relay alone has tripped, check the insulation of core \\nbolts, by applying a voltage of 230 V to 1000 V between the core and each bolt.  If it fails, renew the \\ninsulating bush.  Observe also all the joints, and tap -changer contacts, for over heating and arcing.  \\n \\nf) If the oil shows a low BDV, it does not necessarily mean that it has caused the breakdown.  \\nAt high voltage ratings, excessive moisture content in the oil may result an internal flashover \\nbetween the live parts and earths, which will leave corresponding tell -tale marks.  \\n \\n20217  Circuit Breakers and Interruptors.  \\n \\n  The following types of circuit breakers and interruptors are now in use.  \\n \\nCircuit Breakers:  \\n \\na) 220/132/110/66 KV Double pole  \\n- Minimum oil type  \\n- SF6 type                                                                          [18] \\n b) 25 KV single pole  \\n \\n- Minimum oil type  \\n- SF 6 type  \\n- Vacuum type  \\n \\nc) Interruptors  \\n \\n- Bulk oil type  \\n- Minimum oil type  \\n- SF6 \\n- Vacuum type  \\n \\nOil  type circuit breakers/interruptors require considera ble attention for maintaining satisfactory \\ncondition of the oil.  In case of minimum oil type equipments frequent replacement of oil is \\nnecessary on account of service conditions.  To overcome these limitations, SF -6 type and vacuum \\ntype circuit breakers a nd interruptors are now standardized.  \\n \\nManufacturer’s detailed instructions may be referred to for installation, commissioning, operation \\nand maintenance for all types of breakers/interruptors.  RDSO’s additional instructions on \\nmaintenance and modificatio ns to the circuit breakers/interruptors should also be followed.  Some \\ntips for the maintenance of circuit breakers and interruptors, in general, are given in the succeeding \\nparagraphs.  \\n \\n20218  Guidelines for Maintenance of Circuit Breakers and Interruptor s. \\n \\nA. Minimum Oil Circuit Breakers.  \\n \\n1. Oil \\n \\nWhen a circuit breaker trips the arc is extinguished by the oil and, therefore, the oil gets carbonized \\nand contaminated.  Although 25 KV traction circuit breakers are designed for 100 successive \\ntrippings or for sho rt circuit currents upto 4000 A, without requiring replacement of oil, experience \\nhas shown that because of heavy contamination of oil, insulation level comes down rapidly even \\nwith 40 or 50 trippings.  A record should, therefore, be maintained by the ATFO , based on TPC’s \\nregister/computer print out of the number of trippings of each circuit breaker since last attention.  \\nThe CTFO/PSI should keep a watch over these figures and arrange to measure the BDV of oil \\nsamples at intervals to be decided in the light  of experience.  Oil shall be purified or replaced if the \\ndi-electric strength falls below the prescribed value.  \\n \\n2. Gaskets  \\n \\nDuring inspections, look for evidence of oil leaking out of bushings, tank body, etc. Slight oil leakage \\ncould occur due to (a) the m ating surfaces are not perfectly flat (b) the gasket is not being quite free \\nfrom dirt or extraneous matter (c) the gasket is not being properly compressed (d) gasket has lost its \\nelasticity.  \\n \\nLeaky gaskets shall be attended to or replaced without delay, a s they may allow moisture to get in \\nand contaminate the oil.  \\n \\n3. Bushings  \\n \\nThe porcelain exterior surfaces should be maintained in a perfectly clean and bright condition.  \\nDeposits of salt and industrial dust should be removed periodically so that there may b e no \\npossibility of flash -over. where the     \\n[19] deposits are heavy a wet cloth may be used for wiping it off, falling which carbon tetra -chloride may \\nbe used.  After removing the contamination the surfaces should be wiped out with a dry cloth so that \\nthe gloss on the surface is restored.  \\n \\nDuring inspection the insulator surface shall be very carefully examined all round for any fine \\nsurface cracks so that the damaged insulators may be replaced.  If the chipping on bushing sheds is \\nonly very slight, repla cement may not be necessary.  \\n \\n4. Internal Insulating Parts  \\n \\nEvery time an oil circuit breaker is opened and oil has been drained out, all the interior parts \\nincluding the bushing in the minimum oil type units or tank in the bulk of units should be thoroughly \\ncleaned to remove all traces of carbon or sludge that may have adhered thereto.  Thereafter, the \\nparts should be first cleaned with dry non -fluffy cloth (never with cotton waste), then thoroughly \\nflushed out with good oil and are assembled.  \\n \\n5. Contacts  \\n \\nIt is essential for the contact surfaces to be properly aligned with sufficient area of contact and \\npressure between the contacts to ensure that when carrying full -load currents, the contacts remain \\nquite cool.  Badly pitted or burnt -out contacts should be rep laced before they cause damage to other \\nparts.  If they are only rough, the surface irregularities should be smoothed out by touching up lightly \\nwith a clean line file taking care not to overdo it.  Where the contact mechanism consists of main \\nand secondar y contacts, the main contacts do not normally require any maintenance, because the \\ncurrent is made or broken only at the secondary contacts.  The main contacts should, however, be \\ninspected for good condition and kept smooth and clean.  The adjustment of c ontacts should be \\nmade in accordance with Maker’s instructions.  \\n \\n6. Operating Mechanism  \\n \\nCheck whether the elastic mounting pads are in good condition and capable of absorbing the \\nmechanical shocks during operation.  The length of the breaker stroke should be  measured and \\nadjusted if necessary in accordance with the Maker’s instructions book.  Ensure that the operating \\nmechanism functions smoothly and freely through the entire stroke and without binding.  Lubricate \\nall pins and bearing surfaces with light oil and wipe off the excess.  Ensure that all cotter pins are \\nopen and locking plate and nuts are in place and properly tightened.  \\n \\nThe operating springs are quite powerful and when they are in the charged condition considerable \\nenergy is stored.  Serious dama ge and injury to personnel may be caused if they are released \\ninadvertently.  \\nParts which are scored or which show excessive wear should be replaced and adjustment should \\nbe made within the tolerances as indicated in the Maker’s instruction book.  \\n \\nThe circu it breaker or interruptor is guaranteed to work satisfactorily between the specified voltage \\nlimits.  During annual inspection check performance of interruptors and circuit breakers to ensure \\nthat they function properly at the lowest specified voltage for the operating coil.  Measure and record \\nthe opening and closing times both at normal and minimum voltage.  \\n \\n7. Interlocks  \\n \\nPay attention to the proper functioning of interlocks, both mechanical and electric, and particularly to \\nauxiliary contacts, spring tensi on and screws, bolts, pins, etc. securing the contacts.  Check that the \\nwiring connections at terminal boards are properly secured.  \\n \\n \\n[20] B. SF 6 Circuit Breakers:  \\n \\n1. Gas System  \\n \\nThe SF -6 gas in a pure state is inert, exhibits exceptional thermal stability and  has excellent arc \\nquenching properties as well as exceptional high insulating  properties.  Physical properties of SF -6 \\ngas are indicated in the Annexure 2.05.  There is very little decomposition of the gas after long \\nperiods of arcing.  Such decompositio n has virtually no effect upon dielectric strength and \\ninterrupting capability.  The solid arc product formed by arcing is metallic fluoride which appears in \\nthe form of a fine gray powder which has high dielectric strength under dry conditions as existing  in \\nthe breaker.  A good quality absorbent is used in the apparatus to remove decomposed gaseous by -\\nproduct.  During the maintenance record gas pressure and temperature.  Supply the gas if pressure \\nis less than the prescribed value.  Check setting of gas p ressure switches.  \\n \\n2. Interrupting Unit  \\n   \\nClean the surface of the porcelain and other parts.  Contacts should be inspected and replaced if \\nnecessary.   \\n Renew the absorbent taking care that exposure of the absorbent to the atmosphere is minimal.  \\nThe breake r should be evacuated as soon as possible.  \\n \\n3. Operating Mechanism  \\n \\nCheck stroke from closed position to completely opened position and over stroke from completely \\nopened position to stopped position.  Check prescribed clearances.  Relubricate moving parts.   \\nCheck that pressure gauge is working correctly.  Check pneumatic system for tightness.  \\n \\nThe housing should be checked for water penetration and rust.  Ensure that fasteners are not \\nloosened.  Check connections of control circuit wires for tightness.  \\n \\nC. Vacu um Circuit Breakers  \\n \\nGuidelines as indicated above in case of the other two types of circuit breakers in respect of \\noperating mechanism and its housing and other components are generally applicable in case of \\nvacuum circuit breakers also except the interru pting chamber and pneumatic circuit.  As regards \\ninterrupting chamber (vacuum bottle) no maintenance as such is required to be carried out.  \\n \\n20219  Lead Acid Batteries  \\n \\nA battery is considered to be very vital equipment in the power supply installations an d therefore, its \\nproper maintenance is imperative.  \\n \\nOn electrified sections batteries and battery chargers are installed at the following locations: - \\n \\n1. Traction Sub -Stations – \\n \\n110 V 200 Ah. Lead acid cells for control, protection and indication circuits.  \\n \\n2. Switching Stations – \\n \\n110 V or 72 V, 40 Ah. Lead acid batteries for operation of circuit breakers and interruptors and \\nmotor operated isolators.  \\n3. Remote Control Equipment  \\nBatteries of suitable voltage and capacity at remote control centre, traction sub -station and \\nswitching stations.  \\n[21] To reduce number of batteries at TSS/SS the remote control equipment is now being connected to \\nthe battery of TSS/SS  \\n \\nIn all cases, mains operated battery chargers are provided with facilities for either trickle charge or \\nboost charging.  The rating of the battery charger should  related to the capacity of the battery.  \\n \\n20220  Guidelines for Maintenance of Batteries . \\n \\n1. As the entire system of protection at a sub -station depends upon a sound battery it should \\nalways be in pro per condition.  It should under no circumstances be disconnected when the sub -\\nstation is in operation.  \\n \\nBatteries should be maintained keeping in view instructions of the manufacturer by a trained staff.  \\nThe points to be observed during the inspections ar e summarized below – \\n \\na. General condition of the battery room and cells  \\nb. Specific gravity of electrolyte in the cells  \\nc. Charging current  \\nd. Cell voltage  \\ne. Condition of the plates and extent of deposits  \\nf. Inter-cell connectors and main battery terminals  \\n \\nA detailed his tory of every battery should be separately maintained in which all relevant information \\nis periodically entered.  Fortnightly specific gravity readings should be taken and recorded in \\nappropriate forms.  \\n \\nSmoking or the use of open flames or tools which may  generate sparks is strictly forbidden in the \\nbattery room.  The battery room should be well ventilated and dust free and should have acid \\nproffing done on the walls and flooring.  It should be kept isolated from other electrical equipment.  \\nAppropriate fu se protection for short circuit in the wiring between the battery and distribution switch \\nboard should be provided.  \\n \\n2. Specific Gravity  \\n \\nThe specific gravity of the electrolyte should be maintained at about 1.210 at 27 degree C and when \\nit drops to 1.150 the  cell may be considered discharged.  These values vary with the type of battery, \\ntemperature, age and working conditions.  \\n \\nSpecific gravity is related to electrolyte termperature.  For the purpose of test requirements, the fully \\ncharged specific gravity sh all be 1.20 +  0.005 corrected to 27 degree C.  Temperature correction \\nhydrometer readings of specific gravity shall be made as follows ( Ref. IS 1652)  \\n \\na) For each 1 degree C above 27 degree C add 0.0007 to the observed reading and  \\n \\nb) For 1 degree C below 27 d egree C deduct 0.0007 from the observed reading.  \\n \\nWhen the battery is first commissioned the specific gravity of the all cells would be almost equal.  \\nSubsequently during periodical inspections, variations in specific gravity may be observed due to \\nunequal  rate of evaporation.  This should be corrected by adding distilled water.  In no \\ncircumstances should concentrated or diluted sulphuric acid be added to any cell except when acid \\nis known to have spilled out.  Distilled water alone should be used for topp ing up the level.  \\n \\nHydrometer readings taken when a cell is gassing freely gives the specific gravity of a \\nmixture of gas bubbles and  \\n \\n[22] electrolyte and not the true specific gravity of the electrolyte.  The readings should therefore be \\ntaken after all owing all bubbles to subside.  Hydrometer of reputed make should only be used.  \\nHydrometers of 300 mm length are necessary to give required accuracy.  Two hydrometer should \\nalways be maintained in a station and they should be periodically checked to see th at they read \\nalike.  \\n3. Pilot Cells  \\nOne of the cells in each row of the battery set should be selected and kept as the pilot cell.  \\nReadings should be taken on these cells with sufficient frequency to indicate its state of discharge \\nand charge and serve as a g uide to the condition of the other cells.  The pilot cell when once \\nselected should not be changed unless the cell has to undergo special treatment or repairs in which \\ncase a note should be made immediately on record sheets.  The height of the electrolyte in the pilot \\ncell should invariably be kept at a fixed point (say 12mm) above the top of plats by adding distilled \\nwater every fortnight, if necessary.  \\n4. Trickle Charging  \\nLead acid batteries are very sensitive to overcharging as well as cover discharging. If  over charged, \\nthe positive plates will shed their active material quickly.  If kept in discharged condition for long, the \\nplates will suffer ‘sulphation’ evidenced by appearance of whitish deposits on the plates.  Prolonged \\ncharging at a very low rate aft er emptying the electrolyte and filling the cell with distilled water is \\nsometimes useful if the sulphation is very light.  However, there should be no occasion at all for any \\nbattery set used in stationery traction installations to be sulphated, as they a re continuously on \\ntrickle charge.  A long life for the battery is achievable if the battery is kept floating on a battery \\ncharger so that the terminal voltage of each cell is maintained close to 2.15 V.  \\n \\nThis can be achieved if the battery is kept on a ve ry low rate of charge, say, 1 milli -ampere per Ah \\ncapacity of the battery.  The exact rate of charge should be fixed having regard to the normal and \\nintermittent rates of discharge over a period of 24 hours, so that the battery is always kept in fully \\ncharged condition and never overcharged or over -discharged.  \\n \\nWhen a battery is being properly float -charged very small gas bubbles (about the size of a pin head)  \\nrise slowly from the plate to the surface of the electrolyte in batteries, that are being overcha rged the \\nbubbles are much larger and reach the surface at a higher rate.  \\n5. Cell Voltage  \\nThe voltage of cell at the end of charger is not a fixed value but will vary depending on the age of \\nthe battery.  The temperature, specific gravity of the electrolyte an d charging rate.  The voltage of \\nnew cells at the end of a full charge will be about 2.5 to 2.75 V when it is receiving charge at the 10 \\nhour rate.  This gradually decreases as the age of the battery increases until it comes down to 2.4 V \\nwith normal tempe rature and charging rate.  \\n \\nNo cell should ever be discharged below the point where the cell voltage reaches 1.85 V as \\nmeasured when the cell is discharging at the normal 10 hour rate.  \\n \\nIt should be noted that the voltage of a cell gives an approximate indi cation of its state of charge ( or \\ndischarge) only when it is being discharged, say at the 10 hour rate, and not when the cell is an \\nopen circuit.  \\n \\nSulphated plates, lug corrosion, partial short circuit due to cracked separators and other defects of a \\nlead-acid cell cause a noticeable drop in the terminal voltage with current flowing in the cell.  This \\ndrop varies with the amount of current flowing and in order to get voltages that can be compared \\nfrom month  to month, the voltages should be taken with the same current flowing in the cell.  The \\ncell testing voltmeters in use should be periodically checked and recalibrated, if necessary.  When \\nnot in use they should be kept in a safe place.  \\n \\n6. Condition of Plates and Deposits  \\nThe active material in the positive  plates in healthy cells in use for more than 12 months (when fully \\ncharged) should  \\n[23]  be chocolate in color and  negative plates light or bluish grey according to age.  The chief indications of weak \\ncells are badly coloured plates, irregularity in gass ing or entire failure to gas and a fall in voltage and specific \\ngravity below that of other cells.  \\n \\nIn new batteries, flakes of brown scale will be seen getting detached from edge of positive plates.  This \\nformation of scale is normal.  Until all this scal e is dispersed, the plate cannot be considered as stabilized.  \\nSometimes pieces of this scale may lodge across adjacent negative plates and cause a partial short circuit.  \\nSuch flaked pieces should be gently dislodged with a thin piece of wool and allowed to fall to the bottom of the \\ncell.  This scaling occurs only on the edges of the plates.  The removal of the scales should be done very \\ncarefully so that the plates are not damaged.  \\n \\nExamine carefully the physical condition of the plates such as cracks, di stortions, accumulation of whitish \\ndeposits, etc.  \\n \\nThe color of the deposits gives a good indication of the state of health of the cells.  Whitish deposit indicates \\nundercharging leading to discharged condition.  In healthy cells, the deposit is brown in c olour but excessive \\nshedding of active material for the positive plates indicates overcharging of the battery.  If this is noticed, \\nreduce the rate of charge immediately.  If all the cells in a battery show whitish deposits immediate action \\nshould be taken  to give  a boost charge at an appropriate rate and then to increase the trickle charging rate \\nsufficiently to keep the battery in a healthy condition all the time.  Weak cells should be immediately examined \\nfor any possible short circuit or metallic conta ct between positive and negative plates.  The short circuit should \\nbe removed and the cell should then be given special additional charging by cutting it out and putting it back \\nagain when a healthy condition is regained, after it is attended to.  \\n \\n7. Inter-Cell Connectors  \\n \\nThe inter -cell connectors of the battery should be examined to ensure that they are clean and tight, making \\nperfect contact with cell lugs and that no corrosion is taking place.  Light viseline should be applied to prevent \\ncorrosion.  \\n \\nInspec tion of copper inter -row connectors should also be made for any signs of copper sulphate corrosion \\nwhich should be cleaned up.  Acid -proof paint or enamel should be applied to all exposed copper work in the \\nbattery room and any flaking of paint work given prompt attention.  \\n \\n20221  Protective Relays  \\n \\n1. Each electrified division shall have specialist staff attached to the Central Repair Shop trained in the \\nmaintenance overhauling, testing adjustment and calibration of protective relays as well as indicating, \\nintergrating and recording  instruments.  Such specialist staff shall hold competency certificate No. TR -7 as \\nexplained in Chapter XII.  \\n \\n2. The Central Repair Shop should be fully equipped with necessary apparatus, instruments, tools and \\nequipment for overhauli ng, testing and calibration of relays.  \\n \\n3. Each Supervisor responsible for maintenance and testing of protective relays should maintain a \\nregister in which full details regarding each relay should be entered.  The details to be recorded are the type \\nand seria l number, PT & CT ratios, range of settings available, characteristic curves (where applicable), \\nlocation where installed, schematic diagram of connections, normal settings and details of calculations for \\nfixing the normal setting.  Details of tests as wel l as repairs carried out should be entered in this register from \\ntime to time.  These particulars should also be maintained in the office of Sr. DEE/TRD.  \\n \\n4. No alterations in the settings of protective relays should be carried out without the written \\nauthori zation of Sr. DEE/TRD, who will submit proposals including detailed calculations for changes required, \\nif any, for prior approval of CEE.  Guidelines for setting of relays are given in the Appendix V.  \\n \\n5.     The procedure for commissioning of protective rela ys has been given in Chapter IX.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[24] 6. The normal maintenance attention required for relays in service is generally as under – \\n \\na) It is essential to ensure that the cover gaskets are in good condition and the fixing screw quite tight, \\nso that the instrum ent is dust -tight.  \\n \\nb) Manual operation to confirm that the relays do operate the trip circuits in the manner prescribed.  \\nThese tests should be carried out by atleast at the level of AEE once in a year for all relays.  Simultaneously \\nvisual checks on relay c onnections, condition of the trip battery, trip and alarm circuits, and also the dust -\\ntightness of protective covers should be made.  The relay cover should then be sealed.  A record should be \\nmaintained showing the date and time this is done.  \\n \\nOn each occ asion when the seal is broken subsequently the reasons should be recorded in the log book.  \\nc) Distance protection relay may be tested for calibration once in a year with primary injection set.  \\n \\nd) Secondary injection test -  These should be done annually prefera bly before onset of busy season, \\nmaking use of portable testing equipment and at the settings approved by the competent authority.  Apart \\nfrom testing the operation at the normal setting tests should also be carried out at other settings to make sure \\nthat the relay has the required characteristic.  \\n \\ne) Overhaul bench tests and calibration :  These are necessary once in ten years of when a relay is not \\nfound functioning correctly.  This work should invariably be carried out only in the Central Repair Shop by \\nhighly skilled technicians fully conversant with all details of construction and adjustment.  \\n \\nThe bench tests and final calibration should be carried out after overhaul of the moving parts and \\nmeasurement of coil resistance and other data.  Transport of the r elays to and from the Central Repair Shop \\nalso requires utmost care including locking of the moving parts and careful packing and handling.  When \\nlaboratory tests are fully satisfactory, the relays should be sealed and date of overhaul painted on the outer  \\ncover of the relay.  \\n \\n    20222  Guidelines for Maintenance of Switching Stations  \\n \\nThe maintenance required for equipment in switching stations is more or less similar to that for traction sub -\\nstation equipment, except that traction transformers, circuit b reakers and current transformers are not present \\nand area is much smaller.  However, the only additional but important item which requires attention is \\ncondition of the return feeder connection to all the rails (at the feeding posts).  These return feeder \\nconnections are liable to be damaged by Permanent Way gangs in their normal work of packing and \\nmaintaining the permanent way.  Supervisory officials, therefore, should stress the importance of these from \\nthe electrical point of view to the PWIs so that th ey in turn may warn their maintenance gangs not to damage \\nthe connections.  In addition, the supervisory officials shall, during their periodical inspection, make it a point \\nto inspect the return feeder rail connections and ensure that they are in excellen t condition.  \\n \\nIV  MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES  \\n \\n20223  Schedules of Inspection  \\n \\n1. In order to achieve high reliability and ZERO DEFECT, and to ensure effective checks on the \\nmaintenance work minimum schedules of inspections to be carried out each month by the TRD o fficers and \\nSr. Subordinates in charge of operation and maintenance of PSI equipments, are indicated at Annexure 2.01.  \\n \\nThe schedule of inspections as indicated is the minimum quota to each official per month and should be \\nindependent of other tasks.  The y will not be of routine nature but shall be carried out in depth to identify:  \\n \\ni)  Deficiencies and short comings.  \\n \\nii) Lack of skill amongst staff.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[25] iii)  Inadequacies in maintenance facilities.  \\niv)  Constraints experienced  \\nv) Conditions of envior ment, which lead to poor quality of work if any.  \\n \\n2. The inspecting officials should adjust their inspections in such a manner as to cover all of the \\ninstallations in their jurisdiction within the stipulated periods and stagger the inspections among \\nthemselve s to avoid over inspections of the some installations repeatedly in a very short time and \\nneglect of other installations.  A check list in brief for various inspections is given in the Annexure \\n2.02.  \\n \\n3. The items of attention listed hereunder at any particul ar periodicity are over and above those \\nmentioned in the previous schedule.  This should be kept in view while carrying out maintenance \\nwork.  \\n \\n4. The periodicity of the items of attention listed in the following paragraphs may be modified to \\nsuit local requir ements with the approval of CEE.  \\n \\n5.

The conventional Buchholz Relay is \\nuniversally used in transformers to protect  against severe damages.  However, its limitation is that \\nenough gas must be generated first to saturate the oil fully and then to come out or there should be \\na gas surge to operate this relay.  Moreover, Buchholz Relay is never meant to be a diagnostic \\ndevice for preventive maintenance of transformers.  \\n \\n1.2 The DGA technique is very sensitive as it detect gas in parts per million (ppm) of the oil by \\nuse of the GAS Chromatograph, it is possible to check whether a transformer under service is being \\nsubjected to a normal aging and heating or whether there are incipient defects such as Hot Spots, \\nArcing, Overheating or Partial discharges.  Such incipient faults otherwise remain undetected until \\nthey develop into a major failure.  \\n \\n2.0 Formation of Gases in Oil Filled Tr ansformers . \\n2.1 It is well known that insulating oil in high voltage equipments can break down under the \\ninfluence of the thermal and electrical stresses to produce hydro -carbon gases, hydrogen and \\ncarbon oxides.  Gases may be formed in transformers and other high voltage oil filled equipment \\ndue to aging and to a greater extent as a result of faults.  The accumulation of gases in transformer \\noil may be sudden due to a severe arcing fault or more gradual as in the case of slow deterioration \\nof insulation.   The  principle mechanism of gas formation in a transformer tank can be classified as \\nunder:  \\n \\nA_  Oxidation b) Vapourisation, c) Insulation decomposition d) Oil breakdown e) Electrolytic action  \\n \\n2.2 Oxidation  \\n  Carbon dioxide is the gas predominantly liberated duri ng the process of oxidation.  The process \\nbegins when small quantities of oil combine chemically with the dissolved oxygen in the oil resulting \\nin formation of traces of organic acids.  These acids react with the metal of the transformer, forming \\nmetal bas ed soaps which dissolve in the oil and act as a catalyst to accelerate the process of \\noxidation.  \\n \\n2.3 Vapourisation  \\nThe vapourisation of oil occurs at about 280 degree C while that for water occurs at about 100 \\ndegree C.  The false alarm of a Buchholz relay ma y be attributed to the fact that the condensation of \\nwater  vapour takes place when the excess moisture in the tank is vapourized by a heat source.  \\nFalse alarm can also occur, when hydro -carbons, the constituents of the insulating oil, vapourize.  \\n2.4 Insulati on Decomposition  \\nThe solid insulants in power transformers are mainly of cellulose or resinous type, viz. Paper, press \\nboard, cotton, resins and varnishes.  These substances contain in their molecular structure \\nsubstantial amounts of oxygen , cabin and hyd rogen.  In the temperature range of 150 degree C to \\n400 degree C the insulation breakdown results in liberation of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon \\nmonoxide.  Above 400 degree C the gases formed are relatively less.  \\n \\n2.5 Oil Break Down  \\nThe direct break down  of oil by arcing results in cracking of the oil.  The aromatic contents \\nbreakdown into simple           [41]  hydro carbon gases and hydrogen.  Acetuylene and methane are the major constituents.  Other \\nhydrocabon gases may also be liberated due to cracking .  If the necessary temperature is \\nmaintained for their stable formation.  \\n \\n2.6 Electrolytic action  \\n \\nHydrogen and oxygen are liberated during electrolytic action.  Presence of minute and small \\nparticles of fibres within the oil leads to electrolytic action.  Li ght hydrocarbon gases may also be \\npresent.  If solid insulation is involved.  \\n \\n3.0 Types of Fault Conditions  \\n \\nThere are three main types of fault viz. Overheating of windings, core and joints, partial discharges, \\nand arcing.  \\n \\n3.1 Overheating  \\n \\nOverheating metallic p arts heat up the surrounding regions such as paper insulating tapes and oil.  \\nThis leads to thermal deterioration of these materials.  Thermal degradation of paper produces \\ncarbon dioxide.  Carbon monoxide and water.  The ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is \\ntypically five, but if the ratio falls below three, there is indication of severe overheating  of the paper.  \\nOil degradation produces a number of hydro carbon gases such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and \\nacetylene.  Methane and ethane are deco mposition products that appear above 120 degree C \\nethylene appears above 150 degree C while acetylene is a high temperature product, appearing at \\nseveral hundred degrees centigrade.  Some hydrogen is also produced along with the hydro \\ncarbons gases.  The p roportion of the various hydrocarbons varies with temperature.  This is the \\nbasis of the well known Ratio code introduced several years ago by Dorenberg and R.R. Rogers.  \\n \\n3.2 Partial Discharge  \\n \\nThe second type of fault condition is partial discharge  which occ urs due to ionization of oil in highly \\nstressed areas where gas/vapour filled voids are present or the insulation is continuing moisture.  \\nThe main product during particle discharge is hydrogen, though small amounts of methane and \\nother gases would also be  present depending upon thermal digression.  The disintegration of oil and \\ncellulose due to particle discharge is characterized by the removal of the outer hydrogen atoms to \\nform hydrogen gas.  The remaining molecular framework polymerizes and long chain p roducts such \\nas waxes are formed.  Thermal degradation  is a more predictable phenomenon which involves the \\nbreak up of chemical bonds.  Cellulose decomposes ultimately to CO, CO2 and water; oil break up \\ninto lower molecular hydro carbons.  \\n \\n3.3 Arcing  \\n \\nThe thi rd type of fault condition is arcing.  Arcing can occur between leads, between lead and coil \\nand between other highly stressed regions weakened by fault conditions.  The high temperature \\ncaused by arcing results in the production of acetylene and hydrogen.  \\n \\n3.4 Pattern of generation of gases in transformer is summarized below:  \\n \\nFAULT/PATTERN     KEY GAS   \\nConductor Overheating    CO/CO 2 (carbon oxides)  \\nOil overheating     C2 H2 (Ethylene)  \\nParticle discharge     H2 ( Hydrogen)  \\nArcing       C2H2 (Acetylene)  \\n4.0 Solubility  of Gases.  \\n4.1 The solubility of gases in oil varies with temperature and pressure.  While solubility of H2, \\nN2,CO, O2 in             [42] oil increases with temperature and that of CO2, C2, H2, C2 H4 and C2 H6 decreases with \\ntemperature, solubility of CH4 rema ins essentially constant.  \\n \\nAll the gases become more soluble in oil with increase in pressure.  Solubility of gas is one of the \\nfactors contributing to the complexities in formulating permissible levels of gases on the basis of \\nservice life of a transforme r.  Table I show solubility of different gases 25 degree C and at 1 atm.  \\nThe homogenerity or the gases in the oil is dependent on the rate of gas generation, access of the \\nfault area to flowing oil, rate of oil mixing and presence of gas blanket.  \\n \\n5.Disso lved Gas Analysis (DGA)  \\n \\n5.1 Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of the oil of a transformer in operation is a specialized \\ntechnique to assess the internal condition of the transformer.  DGA is performed by Gas \\nChromatography.  The gases extracted from the oil by a s uitable apparatus are transferred to the \\nGas Chromatograph system for analysis.  \\n \\n5.2 The knowledge of solubility of Hydro -carbon and fixed gases at different temperatures, in \\ninsulating oils helps in interpretation of gas analysis.  The permissible concentrati on of dissolved \\ngases in the oil of healthy transformer is shown in table II.  The combinations of Gas levels for \\ndifferent types of faults are shown in Table III while table IV shows the gas composition by volume \\nunder arcing fault with participation of v arious components of solid dielectrics in a transformer.  \\n \\n5.3 While the absolute concentration of fault gases gives an indication of status of insulation of \\ntransformer, whereas the relative concentration of these gases provides a clue to the type of fault.  \\nFor fault diagnosis the method based on Rogers ‘Analysis is adopted.  \\n \\n5.4 Ropger’s method:  \\n \\nThis method hold good for hydro carbon gasses  By evaluating the gas ratios, the type of fault is \\ndetected.  Four ratios are used viz. Methane/Hydrogen, Ethane/Methane, Ethylene/Ethane and \\nAcetylene/Ethylene.  The value of ratios can be greater or smaller than unity.  The ratio and type of \\nfault represented by that ratio are given in Table V.  \\n \\n6.0 Data Collection and Analysis.  \\n \\n6.1 It is recommended that DGA be performed irregula rly once a year on every transformer upto \\n4 years of service and thereafter twice a year upto 10 years and the frequency thereafter may be \\nincreased to thrice a year.  \\n \\nNote:  Wherever the Buchholz relay operates, the dissolved gas analysis be carried out i mmediately \\nafter operation of the relay to ascertain the cause of fault.  \\n \\n6.2 The results of the DGA for each transformer should be built into a data and based on the \\ntrend of the gas levels over a period of time as well as the faults, if any, that the transfo rmer had \\nsuffered, an analysis may be done to establish the exact nature of the incipient fault that may be \\ndeveloping in the transformer.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[43]  \\n \\n \\nTABLE I  \\n \\n      \\n   SOLUBILITY OF DIFFERENT GASES IN TRANSFORMER OIL AT 25 DEGREE C 1 atm  \\n \\nGas                     Volume %  \\n     With reference to volume of oil  \\n \\nHydrogen      7 \\nOxygen      16 \\nNitrogen      8.6 \\nArgon       15 \\nCarbon Monoxide     9 \\nCarbon dioxide     120 \\nMathene      30 \\nEthane       280 \\nEthylene      280 \\nAcetylene      400 \\nPropylene      400 \\nPropane      1900  \\nButane       4000  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    TABLE II  \\n \\n   RANGE OF GAS LEVELS  \\n        (All concentrations are in PPM)  \\n \\nGas   0-4 years    4-10 years  10 years.  \\n \\nMethane   10-30  30-80  30-130 \\nEthane    10-30  30-50  30-110 \\nEthylene   10-30  30-50  50-150 \\nAcetylene   10-16  10-30  10-40 \\nHydrogen   20-150  150-300 200-500 \\nCarbon Monoxide  200-300 300-500 500-700 \\nCarbon Dioxide  3000 -4000  4000 -5000  4000 -10,000  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[44]  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n.

For better utilization of traction assets, outage of any traction equipment from service should be minimum \\nwithout compromising on safety of the equipment and personnel.  Monitoring of condition of the \\nequipment by reliable means is essential for following the system of need based maintenance i.e. directed \\nmaintenance. However, till such time reliable condition monitoring technique s are introduced, the present \\nsystem of preventive maintenance has to continue.  \\n2. Recommendations of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Guidelines issued by RDSO, from \\ntime to time, shall be kept in view while defining the scope and periodicity of the  schedules.  \\n3. The tightening torque for fasteners of various sizes is given in the Annexure 2.08.  \\n \\n20305  Out of Plumb Masts  \\n \\nInspite of the care taken in design and erection,  OHE masts do sometimes get out of plumb.  This occurs \\nlargely on embankments, due  to erosion of earthwork on the outer side of the mast on account of poor \\ndrainage or excavations in the vicinity or due to sinking of foundations onnew embankments.  The extent of \\nearthwork initially provided at the back of foundations on embankments is s hown in Structure Erection   \\n(SEDs).  OHE maintenance staff should, during patrolling and  inspections, make a particular check of the \\ncondition of earthwork  has been or is likely to be eroded away, the Engineering Department should be \\napproached to stren gthen the embankment, and the matter pursued until it is satisfactorily completed.  \\n \\nMasts which appears to be out of plumb should be checked with a plumb bob.  Since the normal height of the \\ncontact wire is 5.60 m above rail level, the extent of deflection  of the masts at this height can be conveniently \\nfound by measuring the deflection at a height of 1.85 m above rail level and multiplying this figure by 3.  If the \\nmast is out of plumb, by more than 3 cm upto 5 cm, it should be kept under watch after makin g sure that there \\nis enough earthwork all round.  To identify such masts  requiring watching, a yellow bend of width 5 cm should \\nbe painted at a height of 1.85 m from rail level.  \\n \\nMasts which are out of plumb in excess of 5 cm can be set right  by releasi ng the OHE and pulling the mast \\nby a “Tirfor”.  To facilitate this, the foundation must first be exposed on the side to which the mast is to be \\npulled by the Tirfor., and the rear under side of the foundation should be packed and rammed with pieces of \\nstone until the foundation is fully supported.  If necessary the newly packed part may be strengthened by \\npouring in cement  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI        [60] \\n  \\n \\n Any other method considered appropriat e as per site conditions may be adopted.  \\n \\nRDSO’s report No. ETI/OHE/55 on Tilting of OHE masts, Causes and Remedies may also be \\nreferred to.  \\n \\n20306  Rail Level and Setting Distance  \\n \\nStructure Erection  (SEDs) show setting distance or implantation of the OH E masts i.e. distance of \\nthe nearest part of mast from the centre line of the nearest track as well as the height of the contact \\nwire from rail level at each location.  These are with reference to alignment and level of the track at \\nthe time of erection of  OHE.  Before electrification work is taken up, it should be ensured that the \\ntrack alignment and level are finalized.  This is particularly so in the case of yards under remodeling.  \\n \\nAny change in alignment due to slewing of tracks will affect the setting  distance and consequently \\nthe stagger of the contact wire.  At locations where the setting is critical i.e. close to the minimum \\npermissible value, slewing of track may result in infringement of the moving dimensions with \\nconsequent danger of accidents.  Change in rail level due to variation in ballast cushion or packing \\nup or packing down of the track will also result in change in contact wire height.  Though provision \\nexists in the cantilever assembly for adjustments of the stagger and height, such adjus tment are not \\nto be made unless absolutely necessary.  It is best to maintain the position of OHE and tracks as in \\nthe SEDs.  \\n \\nGeneral Rule (1976) 17.06 stipulates as under:  \\n \\nAlteration to track  \\n“Before any alteration to alignment or level of electrified tr ack is commenced, due notice shall be \\ngiven to those responsible for the overhead equipment so that the overhead equipment may be \\nadjusted to conform to the new conditions:”  \\n \\nIf follows, therefore, that any alterations of the alignment of the track on elec trified sections shall \\nonly be made with the prior knowledge and concurrence of the Sr. DEE(TRD) so that he may \\narrange to correct the SEDs to the extent required.  No alterations to the track affecting OHE \\nparameters may be carried out without obtaining s pecific approval from Sr. DEE(TRD).  Whenever \\nany permanent changes are effected, the SEDs should be revised and a note made of the \\ncircumstances and the authority under which the revision has been made.  \\n \\nTo facilitate periodical checking, rail level and s etting distance should be painted at the base of each \\nOHE mast face soon after commissioning, preferably in black letters.  A horizontal line would \\nindicate the rail level. The setting should be marked in correct to the second decimal place.  \\nRepainting of  the these markings will ordinarily be required once in two years.  Where pollution due \\nto brake shoe dust etc. is severe, repainting may be required more often.  \\n \\nDuring yearly maintenance of OHE, rail level and setting distance should be checked and compa red \\nwith the original figures.  Any variations above 30 mm is setting distance and 20 mm in rail level \\nshould be advised to the PWI for correction.  No change in setting distance and rail level should be \\nallowed if such change results in infringement of mo ving dimensions.  \\n \\nIt is essential to have a joint annual check of rail level and setting distance by the Chargeman/OHE \\nand APWI.  \\n \\nIn addition to the marking on the masts, a register should be maintained by CTFO(OHE) to record \\nthe annual measurements of imp lantation at critical locations over his jurisdiction.  A similar register \\nshould be maintained by each Chargeman for his own section (see proforma 03 -8 in Section –V) \\n \\nLimits for mast setting distances are indicated in Appendix I.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRAC TION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI         [62] 20307  Contact Wire Hard Spots and  Wear  \\n \\nHard spots are points on the OHE where contact wire wear is likely to be higher than at normal \\nlocations, due to less flexibility in the OHE.  Smoke pollution aggravates  wear at hard spots.  The \\nusual spots where the contact wire is likely to show more wear are – \\n \\n1. Support points at curves.  \\n2. Section insulators.  \\n3. Splices  \\n4. Turn outs  \\n5. Central mast of 2 span uninsulated overlaps of unregulated OHE>  \\n6. At approaches to tunnels and ove r line structures.  \\n7. Locations where smoke pollution is pronounced, namely, tunnels with steam traction and at the \\nends of platforms where steam locos halt for a long time under OHE.  \\n8. Pull offs  \\n \\nAt such hard spots, it is important to keep a watch on wear of c ontact wire by measuring and \\nkeeping a record of contact wire thickness periodically.  It is essential to concentrate on these spots \\nduring annual measurement of contact wire wear.  \\n \\n20308  Sparking During Current Collection  \\n \\nSparking occurs when there is l oss of contact ( or improper contact) between the pantograph and \\nthe contact wire.  The common causes attributable to the OHE are:  \\n \\n1. Incorrect tension in regulated OHE due to maladjustment or sluggish operation of regulating \\nequipment;  \\n2. Inadequate tension of  contact wire in the case of unregulated OHE;  \\n3. Deposit of soot on contact wire due to steam and diesel traction and the resulting roughness of \\ncontact face during current collection;  \\n4. Kinks in contact  wire.  \\n \\nIf OHE on the main line is unregulated the tensio n in the contact wire should be checked and \\nadjusted if need be once in 2 years.  The speed being low in yards and sidings, the adverse effect of \\nincorrect tensioning will be less pronounced and re -tensioning at longer intervals of 3 -4 years will be \\nadequa te (para 20330)  \\n \\nDeposits of soot on account of steam and diesel traction may cause trouble due to sparking at \\npoints where steam engines halt for long periods.  Particular note should be made of such locations \\nand cleaning done at shorter intervals.  The importance of cleaning of contact wire before \\nintroduction of electric traction is dealt with in Chapter IX.  \\n \\nKinks detected during patrolling and inspection should be straightened or/removed without delay.  \\nAfter re -tensioning it is particularly necessary  to inspect the section for kinks.  \\n \\nThe periodic current collection tests (para 20324) would reveal points where sparking takes place.  \\nApart from investigating and rectifying the cause of such sparking, it is also important that the \\nroughened surface of t he contact  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI       [63] wire be attended to, failing which, there will be further deterioration, with successive passage of pantographs \\nresulting in reduced life of contact wire.  \\n \\n20309  Contact  Wire Wear  \\n \\nHard drawn grooved copper contact wire of 107 mm 2 cross sectional area when new is used in the 25 kV \\nelectric traction system.  With a proper maintenance of the OHE the contact wire is expected to have a life of \\nabout 30 years, with average tr affic density and conditions of pollution.  \\n \\nThe thickness of new contact wire is 12.24 mm.  It will be necessary to replace the contact wire when it has \\nworn to a thickness of 8.25 mm corresponding to a cross sectional area of approximately 74 mm2.  At thi s \\npoint 2 mm clearance shall be available between the bottom most point of the dropper clip, parallel groove \\nclamp as well as contact wire splice and the pan of pantograph.  Any further reduction in cross sectional area \\nwill result in the current density i n the contact wire splice and the pan of pantograph.  Any further reduction in \\ncross sectional area will result in the current density in the contact wire under certain conditions exceeding the \\npermissible limit of 4.7 A/mm2 apart from reduced factor of sa fety under tension.  In siding and lines with a \\nlow traffic density, a lower thickness limits of 8 mm may be adopted.    \\n \\nIt is important to measure and record the wear of contact wire at the known hard spots (para 20307) and at a \\nfew selected locations wh ere heavy wear may be expected, so as to keep a watch on the rate of wear.  \\nObservations have indicated the wear of contact wire between starter and advance starter is high where the \\ntrain picks speed, specially in suburban sections.  In addition to the kn own hard spots, the wire thickness may \\nbe measured at one or two points between each pair of stations where speed  is maximum.  These \\nmeasurements should be taken at the time of yearly maintenance and recorded in a register.  When the \\naverage wire thicknes s has reached approximately 10 mm, the number of points where measurement is taken \\nmay be increased and one location in each tension length may be covered in addition to the known hard \\nspots.  \\nMeasurements of contact wire thickness in the vertical directio n should be made with a micrometer, preferably \\none fitted with a ratchet screw adjustment to ensure that the pressure between the jaws when taking \\nmeasurement does not exceed a particular value.  Considerable care is required in using the micrometer.  \\n \\nThe measurement will be meaningful only if in successive years the thickness is measured at the same point \\nat each location.  It is only then that the values recorded can be directly compared.  A 75 mm wide band may \\nbe painted on the mast fact with black paint .  If the location is identified in this manner and a convention \\nfollowed that measurement should be taken say 20 mm before the swivel clip in the direction of motion.  It can \\nbe ensured that in successive years, measurement will be taken at identical poin ts.  The measurements must \\nbe taken personally by a supervisor well acquainted with the use of micrometer.  Registers should be \\nmaintained in the office of the ATFO(OHE) for his jurisdiction and CTFO(OHE) for the entire division in \\nproforma 03 -4 given in S ection V.  \\n \\nIf any  isolated point the contact wire reaches the condemning limit of thickness, a splice should be introduced  \\nat the point.  \\n \\n20310  Splice Fittings  \\n \\nThe splice in OHE becomes necessary when a small length requires replacement as a result of excessive \\nwear or restoration after breakdown.  \\nThe splice fittings commonly in use are – \\n1. splice for single contact wire to identification No. 1080 or 1080 -1 \\n2. splice for double contact wire to identification No. 1280  \\n3. splice for Catenary to identification No.  1090  \\n4. splice for feeder wire to identification No. 1100  \\n \\nThe main components are made of aluminum bronze and the studs of contact wire splice are of stainless \\nsteel.  Samples of splices from each batch of supply are required to be subjected to special tens ile tests in \\naddition to the normal tests for quality of material, in view of the need for ensuring reliability of these important \\nfittings.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI        [64] \\n A splice should, as far as possible, be loc ated at a distance of not less than 5 m from the support in \\nthe direction of traffic to avoid a hard spot on the OHE.  Not more than 15 splices shall be used in \\none tension length.  The distance between adjacent splices should, as far as possible, be more than \\n100 m.  \\n \\nIn new construction normally no splice shall be provided.  Under exceptional circumstances a \\nmaximum of two splices may be permitted.  \\n \\nThe main points requiring attention during inspection of splice fittings are – \\n \\n1. Careful examination for crac ks or other casting defects or abnormalities.  \\n2. In case of Catenary splice fitting tightness of the right hand and left -hand joint sockets.  \\n3. Check to see if any slipping of the ends of two contact wires has taken place.  When viewed \\nthrough the top window, th ere should be no gap between the two contact wire ends.  \\n4. Tightness of the stainless steel studs.  \\n \\nContact wire splices should not ordinarily be re -used.  If they are re -used at all, new brass ferrules \\nfor contact wire splice to Id No. 1080 should invariably  be used to ensure that worn serrations of the \\nferrules do not result in insufficient grip on the contact wire.  \\n \\nOver -tightening of the stainless steel studs of contact wire splice fittings is harmful.  Tightening \\nshould only be done to the extent possible  with a standard spanner.  No extra leveraile by means of \\na pipe etc. should be used.  \\n \\nRegisters should be maintained in the Offices of Sr. DEE(TRD), AEE(TRD), CTFO(OHE), \\nTFO/ATFO(OHE) and OHE Section Chargeman showing the location and date of installation  of all \\nsplice fittings under their jurisdiction.  These registers should be brought up -to-date by taking an \\ninventory of splice fittings during yearly maintenance and POH.  \\n203011  Section Insulator Assembly  \\n1. Section Insulators assembly is used to provide e lectrical isolation between two elementary \\nsections which are otherwise continuous.  They are used mainly on cross overs, diamond \\ncrossings and turnouts for loops and sidings to isolate section from main line.  They may be \\nused on main lines to form neutra l sections in heavily graded sections, suburban sections and at \\ninspection pits on secondary lines as well as lines for sheds for maintenance and inspection.  \\nRules regarding the location of section insulators are contained in Appendix I; the speed \\npermiss ible at these locations is also indicated therein.  \\n \\n2. The section insulator assembly is shown Fig. 3.02.  The assembly comprises of a strain \\ninsulator with two runners connected to one of  contact wires.  The bottom of the runners is at \\nthe same height as th e contact wire on the other side, and so shaped as to allow a smooth \\npassage of the pantograph underneath it.  The two runners overlap with the contact wire on the \\nother side for  a short length to ensure that there is no interruption in the current drawn by the \\nlocomotives as it passes underneath the section insulator.  The flexibility of the OHE is reduced \\nwhere a section insulator assembly is provided.  \\n \\n3. The essential points to be checked during periodical maintenance are as under - \\na) The weight of the secti on insulator should be fully taken up  by the droppers so that the runners \\nare at the same height as the adjacent contact wires both longitudinally and transversely.  \\nFasteners are provided, at both the contact wire ending clamps, at the ends of the contac t wire \\nand link assembly and section insulator cross beam assembly, for effecting the adjustment \\naccurately.  When correctly adjusted, there should be no sparking when a pantograph \\nnegotiates it.  The runners if bent or damaged should be either replaced or  straightened out.  \\nThe runners as well as the contact wire should be smoothened by filling off globules of copper \\nwhich might have formed due to arcing.  The distance between the contact wire and the runner \\non either side should be not less than 220 mm.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI       [65]  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n and application of silicone grease should be decided based on the extend of smoke pollution in t he \\narea ( para 20314)  \\n \\nb) The PG clamps holding the stiffeners at both ends should be checked to ensure that the \\nstiffeners do not work loose.  \\n \\n20312  Short Neutral Sections Assembly . \\n         \\n1. Short neutral sections assembly incorporating light weight contact  wire insulator of composite \\ntype ) resin bonded glass fibres core protected with wear resistant ceramic beads) has now \\nbeen adopted as standard.  Ease of installation even on flat curves and difficult locations, \\nsubstantially reduced maintenance and other  advantages are gained by introducing short \\nneutral section.  Conversion of existing overlap type neutral sections to short neutral sections \\nmay be done where it is not yet done. Short neutral sections should also be introduced in lieu of \\ninsulated overlap s opposite to the feeding posts at sub -stations. (Board’s Ref. 86/RE/501/1N/S) \\ndt. 16/22.7.1987.)  \\n \\n2. The general construction, design and other requirements of short neutral sections shall conform \\nto RDSO’s Drg. Nos. (I) ETI/OHE/SK/551 -Arrangement of Neutral  Sections for Conversion with \\nShort N.S. (ii) ETI/OHE/SK/552 -Arrangement of short N.S. at Existing Feeding Post.  \\n \\n3. The essential points to be checked during periodical maintenance are as under:  \\n \\na) cracked beads.  \\nb) Electrical erosion of coating  \\nc) State of cleanlin ess of insulators.  \\nd) Burning of arcing horns and arc traps  \\ne) Pantograph hit marks on the under side of compression ferrules and end sleeves of the contact \\nwire insulators to ascertain need for adjustment to be runners.  \\nf) Freedom of movement of telescopic anti to rsion droppers.  \\ng) Elastomeric bellows for cracks  \\nh) Insulation resistance.  \\n \\n20313  Jumper Connections.  \\n \\nThe following types of jumper connections, using standard copper conductors and PG clamps, are \\nin common use in 25 KV OHE.  \\n \\n1. In-span jumpers of approximately 50 mm2 cross section for electrical continuity between contact \\nand Catenary wires, at intervals not exceeding 400m.  \\n \\n2. Potential equalizer jumpers of approximately 50 mm2 cross section at insulated over laps and \\nneutral sections to keep the portion of OHE be tween the cut in insulators and the nearer \\nanchorage at the same potential as the adjacent run of OHE.  \\n \\n3. Continuity jumpers of cross section 105 mm2 to provide electrical continuity between the two \\nportions of OHE at uninsulated overlaps and between the mai n line OHE and turn out/cross over \\nOHE at turn outs/cross over.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI       [67] \\n \\n 4. Jumpers of cross section 105 mm2 or 150 mm2 between feeders and OHE at feeding points.  \\n5. Jumpers of cross section 50 mm  2 provided between out of run.  OHE and anticreep wire as an \\nanti theft measure.  \\n \\nJumper connections play a vital part in maintaining continuity of supply.  On account of the up and \\ndown movements of the contact wires, the jumper connections are bent to s ome extent every time a \\npantograph passes through.  With repeated bendings the strands of the flexible jumper connections \\nare liable to get broken in course of time on account of fatigue.  To guard against this possibility, \\nspecial attention should be devo ted to the jumpers during periodical maintenance.  \\n \\nThe essential requirements for reliability of jumpers are – \\n \\n1. Sufficient length and adequate looping to provide flexibility so as to prevent failure on account of \\nrepeated up and down movements and movement s on account of elongation and contraction of \\nOHE due to temperature variations.  \\n2. Adequate cross section to carry the normal currents and possible overloads due to shut downs \\non adjacent lines, as well as faults.  \\n3. Proper bonding and in soldering of the ends.  \\n4. Proper seating and tightness of connections at PG clamps.  \\n \\nFailure of continuity jumpers will result in discontinuity  of the OHE and consequent serious \\ninterruption of traffic.  Though failures of potential equalizer jumpers may go unnoticed, such failur es \\ncan result in electrical accidents.  Also, unscheduled attention to such jumpers will necessitate \\npower -block on both the adjacent elementary sections, which may be quite difficult to arrange \\nwithout repercussion to traffic.  Proper attention to jumpers  during scheduled maintenance is, \\ntherefore, very important.  Jumpers, particularly continuity jumpers, with broken strands should be \\ninvariably replaced, failing which the reduced cross -section may cause overheating and eventual \\nfailure.  Broken strands a re most likely at the point of entry into PG clamps, possibly due to sharp \\nedges in the clamp.  PG clamps should have properly rounded off edges to prevent the cutting of \\nstrands.  The clamps should be checked for signs of overheating and proper tightness.  \\n \\nIt should, however, be remembered that a PG clamp should not be interfered with unless there are \\nsigns of overheating or damage.  \\n \\n20314  Environmental Effect on OHE  \\nAtmospheric Pollution  \\n \\nThe atmospheric pollution has caused a large number of insulators flash over in certain areas such \\nas Howradh and Assansol in Eastern Railway.  Ahmedabad, Vadodara,. Surat and Valsad sections \\nof Western Railway and Madras -Gudur section of Southern Railway.  The flash over mainly occur in \\nthe early morning in winter befor e sun rise and in the pre monsoon period, specially when monsoon \\nare delayed.  The pollutants provide a creepage path resulting into flash over of insulators and \\nconsequent tripping of the 25 Kv and EHV circuit breakers.  Pollution can be classified, broad ly into \\nthe following categories.  \\n \\nI_)  Saline Pollution :  caused by salt deposits in coastal areas.  The adverse effect get magnified in \\nfoggy, humid and light rain conditions, resulting in series of  flashovers.  \\n \\nii)_ Chemical and Industrial Pollution :  Waste gases from industries – hydrochloric acid, sulphuric \\nacid, hydrofluoric acid fumes etc. and minute particles of urea, cement etc. affect insulators of the \\nelectrified tracks in the vicinity of these industries.  \\nThese conditions not only effect the i nsulators, but also affect the steel parts including mast, which \\ncorrode rapidly and need frequent attention.  Special steps are required to be taken throughout the \\nyear, suitably modifying the insulator cleaning schedules to ensure trouble free service.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI        [68] 1. Insulators  \\n \\nAlthough insulators supporting OHE are by the side of supporting masts, they are subject to \\nsettlement of carbon deposits, smoke pollution due to steam trains, oily deposits on  account of \\ndiesel engine and cement or other industrial dust as mentioned earlier.  If these deposits are not \\nremoved at regular intervals, they are liable to become hard and difficult to remove in course of \\ntime, and by reducing the insulation of the OHE  greatly, lead finally to a flashover.  Further, a dirty \\ninsulator of a section insulator can result in a dangerous potential in a section made dead.  \\n \\nThe remedy lies in cleaning the insulators at regular intervals.  Where there is no pollution, cleaning \\nneed be done only once a year or even at longer intervals.  Where pollution is not appreciably high, \\nthe interval may be three months or longer depending upon the degree of pollution in the area.  \\nGenerally in heavy industry areas more frequent cleaning of insulators may have to be done.  \\n \\nCleaning is done by wiping the surface with a piece of dry cloth.  A wet cloth may be necessary if \\nthe coating is hard.  If the deposits are oily, petrol may be used for cleaning.  If this too in ineffective \\nwhere encrusta tion has become hard due to continued neglect, the coating may have to be \\nremoved by rubbing with a wet coir rope using a suitable detergent.  After removing the deposits, \\nthe surface of the insulator should be washed well with water, wiped with dry cloth and polished until \\nthe normal glaze is restored.  \\n \\nThe periodicity of cleaning of insulators in polluted locations should be laid down by local \\ninstructions.  The affected section should be divided into various zones based on the degree and \\nnature of pollut ion \\nAnd periodicity of insulator cleaning fixed suitably.  The cleaning will be required more frequently in \\nfoggy weather compared to dry or rainy season.  The periodicity may be reviewed based on effect of \\nspecial measure,  \\n \\nOther steps for reducing flasho vers due to pollution _  \\n i)  Application of High Voltage Insulting Silicone Compound      \\nThe frequency of manual cleaning can be substantially reduced by application of silicone grease or \\nsimilar anti tracking compounds.  Application of high dielectric st rength anti acidic varnish has also \\nbeen found to be useful under certain conditions.  The surface of the insulator is cleaned and then a \\nlight coat of the material is applied so that a dust and water repellent surface is produced.  \\n \\nii) Use of longer creep age path insulators  \\nUse of Insulators of longer creepage path will reduce frequency of cleaning.  \\n \\nThe problem can be tackled in many ways mainly to reduce the frequency  of cleaning, which can \\nbe established by constant endeavor in trying  out what is best  for a specific section over a period of \\n2 to 3 years.  \\n \\n2. OHE Structure and Fittings.  \\n \\nDue to effluents discharged by the factories which are close to the railway tracks, the atmosphere \\ngets surcharged due to presence of corrosive fumes in the effluents.  Su ch cause corrosion of steel \\nstructures and OHE parts.  In order to safeguard against this problem, remedial action as under \\nshould be taken.  \\na) Matter should be taken up with the factories and the Board of Control of Pollution of that area, \\nthey should ensure  that the discharge of the factories is well within the limits laid down by the \\nBoard.  \\nb) A special check at regular intervals should be conducted to see that the corrosion does not \\naffect the performance of the components.  \\nc) Chlorinated paints may be tried on the steel structures to off set the effect of pollution on the \\nsteel structures.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI       [69] 20315  Clearances in Tunnels and Other Overline Structures.  \\n \\nIf the OHE construction as well as the tunnels  and over line structures are not modified subsequent \\nto the electrification, the clearances provided at  the time of erection will remain unaltered.  It is, \\nhowever, important to check the clearances during the annual maintenance, compare the values \\ngiven  in as erected  and take corrective action as required.  \\n \\n20316  Regulating Equipment  \\n1. There are three types of regulating equipment in use at present viz. The winch type, pulley block \\ntype and 3 pulley type.  With all the three types of equipment the chief task of maintenance is to \\nensure that the counter weight is free to move up and down in the guides without any chafing or \\nobstruction.  If the movement of the counterweight is obstructed, the tension of the OHE will not \\nbe correctly regulated resulting in poor current collection.  The counterweight should not come \\ndown so low so as to touch the muffing in summer, nor should if strike the guide fixture at the \\ntop during winter.  \\n \\nDuring yearly maintenance of the pulley block type of equipment dimension ‘X’ (i .e. the distance \\nbetween the centres of the movable and fixed pulleys) and ‘Y’ (i.e. the distance between the bottom \\nof the counterweight and the top of the muffing) should be checked against prescribed values and \\nadjusted as required according to the tens ion length of the OHE and prevailing temperature.  Small \\nadjustment can be effected by using the adjusters provided.  In the event of appreciable stretching \\nof the contact and catenary wires, particularly a few months after installation, it will be necessa ry to \\ncut small lengths of contact and catenary wires at the terminations to get correct alignment and \\nadjustment.  \\n \\nIn the winch type equipment, corresponding to dimension ‘X’ in the pulley block type dimension ‘Z’ \\ni.e. the distance between the centres of the movable pulley and the winch drum is required to be \\nmeasured.  \\n \\nTo facilitate checking, the position of the bottom of the counterweight corresponding to the lowest \\nand highest temperature should be marked on the masts by means of black bands of width 20 mm.  \\nThe position of the counterweight at ambient temperature of 35 degree C may be marked by a red \\nband which can be seen during trolley inspection readily.  The bottom of counter weight should \\ncoincide with the band mark.  \\n \\n2. The usual defects to be looked for in the pulley block type of equipment are – \\n \\na) damage to pulley grooves by the stainless steel rope due to misalignment of the equipment and \\nthe catenary wire being not vertically above the contact wire at the termination;  \\nb) seizing of the needle bearings due to drying up of lubricant and consequent jamming of the \\npulleys;  \\nc) jamming of guide pulley due to lack of lubrication and consequent grooving of the pulley.  This \\ncan be checked by pushing up the counter weight and allowing it to descent due to its own \\nweight;  \\nd) damage to neoprene washers provided between pulleys resulting in ingress of dirt and water \\ninto the needle bearings;  \\ne) bent sliding rods obstructing the movement of the movable pulley;  \\nf) blocking of grease nipples.  \\n \\nThese defects except for replacement of the guide pulley and attention to blocked grease nipples \\nare not capable of being attended to in -situ.  The complete equipment should be replaced with a \\nspare one and the removed equipment taken to the workshop for attention.  \\n \\nThe main pulley and guide pulley bearings of the pulley block type equipment should be lubricated \\nusing approved type of grease which will be able to withstand 60 degree C without drying.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI       [70] Another important check re quired for the pulley block type equipment is to see that that the stop \\nnuts provided at the end of the guide rods are intact.  These are provided to prevent the movable \\npulley coming off the guide rods in the event of breakage of the stainless steel rope.  \\n \\n3. The common defects to be looked for in the winch type equipment are :  \\n \\na) Over riding of stainless steel rope and grazing of grooves.  \\nb) Breakage of strands of stainless steel wire rope.  \\nc) Seizure of pulley bearing.  \\nd) Tilting of anti falling device.  \\n \\nStainless ste el ropes should be examined periodically with a magnifying glass for putting and other \\nsigns of corrosion.  \\n \\nRegulating equipments should be checked periodically for free movement with the help of a spring \\nbalance.  If pull required for a visible movement o f counter weight exceeds 10 kgf. The regulating \\nequipment should be overhauled.  \\n \\nWhenever a panto/OHE entanglement takes place the regulating equipments of all the concerned \\nOHEs should be checked thoroughly, particularly if any of them was overhauled more  than two \\nyears earlier.  \\n \\nUntil such time a grease capable of retaining the properties for 4 years becomes available, all \\nregulating equipments should be overhauled every two years.  Priority should be given to those \\nwhich cover the more vulnerable locatio ns. \\n \\nDuring overhaul of regulating equipment special attention should be paid to the shape and \\ndimensions of the winch frame arms (right and left) as they have a direct influence on the angle of \\nincidence of the stainless steel wire rope on the winch drum.  \\n \\nWhenever a regulating equipment is dismantled, the  condition of the bearing grease should be \\nchecked.  If it is found to have lost its oil content and exhibits the consistency of hard soap, the \\nsource and type of grease used initially should be investig ated.  \\n \\nThe condition of rubber or felt seals provided to prevent the ingress of water into bearings should be \\nchecked and if they have deteriorated, the quality and source should be investigated and remedial \\nsteps taken.  All seals should invariably be rep laced during periodical overhaul unless their condition \\nis found to be good enough to work satisfactorily for another four years.  \\n \\n4. Most of the points mentioned above are also applicable to pulley type regulating equipment \\nwhich is now standard.  \\n \\n20317  OHE  Inspection Car (Tower Wagon)  \\n \\n1. OHE inspection car has a key role in the maintenance of OHE and for attending to break downs.  \\nThe satisfactory upkeep of the car is, therefore, or utmost importance.  ATFO (OHE) should \\nensure that the car under his control i s maintained satisfactorily and is available at all times for \\nattending to OHE and for use in the event of break downs.  \\n \\nEach car should carry necessary tools for maintenance of OHE and attending to breakdowns, such \\nas tackles, straining screws, clamps, ro pes a minimum of two ladders as well as an adequate stock \\nof insulators, lengths of contact and catenary wires and other OHE fittings.  An approved list of tools \\nand equipments to be carried in each care should be issued by DEE(TRD).  ATFO(OHE) should \\nensu re that tools and equipment as per the approved list are always available in the car.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI      [71]  \\n \\n \\n  2. A monthly mechanical inspection of the bogies and running gear of each car shall be done by a \\nnominated TXR of the Mechanical Department, headquartered close to the OHE depot where \\nthe car is normally stabled.  For each car on a Zonal Railway, the TXR responsible for monthly \\nmechanical inspection will be nominated and a joint circular to this effect issued by CME and \\nCEE laying down his duties.  \\n \\nThe ATFO(OHE) in charge of the car will advise the TXR concerned the date on which it is required \\nto be inspected and running repairs carried out.  Such advise shall be given at lest 48 h. in advance.  \\nATFO(OH E) should ensure that this monthly advise is issued regularly and the car is offered for \\ninspection and attended to every month.  The TXR will arrange for examination of bogies., running \\ngear, underframe, under gear fittings and axle boxes only, in accorda nce with IRCA rules, Part -III.  \\nHe will also arrange for stenciling the date of monthly examination on the sole bar of the car.  The \\nPOH of the car shall be done at an interval of 3 years in an EMU shop/electric loco shed/Electric \\nworkshop, as decided by C EE. (Ref. Board’s letter No. 84/Elec/140/4 Vol. I dt. 1.3.90)  \\n \\n3. The day to day maintenance of the diesel engines and driving gear of the car will be the \\nresponsibility of the ATFO(OHE) concerned.  The OHE inspection car drivers should carry  out \\nthe daily m aintenance.  Specialist staff conversant with the maintenance and overhaul of diesel \\nengines and driving gear should be available on each division for attending to monthly and six \\nmonthly maintenance of the diesel engines and driving gear.   If it is more convenient and \\ndepending upon the work load, two or three divisions may be grouped together for the purpose \\nof posting such specialist staff.  \\n \\n4.

In order to achieve high reliability and ZERO DEFECT OHE, and to ensure effective \\nchecks on the maintenance work a minimum schedule of inspections to be carried out \\neach month by the officers and Senior Subordinate in charge o f operation and \\nmaintenance of OHE and associated system, is indicated at Annexure 3.01.  \\n \\n2. The schedule of inspections is the minimum quota for each official and should be \\nindependent of other tasks.  They will not be of routine nature but shall be carried out in \\ndepth to identify.  \\n \\nb) Deficiencies and short comings.  \\n \\nii) Lack of skill amongst staff.  \\n \\niii) Inadequacies in maintenance facilities  \\n \\niv) Constraints experienced  \\n \\nv) Conditions of environment leading to poor quality of work.  \\n \\n3.  The inspecting officials should programme their inspections in such a manner as to cover \\nthe widest areas in their jurisdiction over the year and so stagger the inspections as to avoid \\nover inspections of the same section repeatedly, in a very short time while neglecting other \\nareas.  A check in brief for various inspections is indicated at Annexure. 3.02  \\n \\n20321  General  \\n \\nThe OHE is subject to dynamic oscillations due to the constant contact and movement of the fast \\nmoving pantograph coupled with wind pressure.  It is necessary to maintain the OHE in perfect \\ncondition through proper checks on its geometry and all parameters adopted in the design.  \\n \\nThe following schedules of maintenance for the OHE are required to be followed to ensure good \\ncurrent collection as well as safety of ins tallations and personnel – \\n \\nI) Foot Patrolling  \\nii) Trolley inspection  \\niii) Current collection Tests  \\niv) Special checks  \\nv) Annual Maintenance and OHE Inspection Car Checks.  \\nvi) Periodical Overhaul  \\nvii) Re-tensioning of Unregulated OHE.  \\n \\n2.The importance of OHE arises from the  fact that it is extensive, with a very large number of \\ninsulators, fittings and other parts; failure of any one of which may result in dislocation of \\ntrain services for appreciable periods until the defect/breakdown is rectified.  The adjustment \\nwork is p articularly important at cross overs and at overlaps spans since any departures \\nfrom the standards laid down could cause entanglement of the pantograph with the OHE, \\nwith serious repercussions.  The need for a thorough detailed inspection of every part of the \\ninstallation, mast by mast need not therefore be over -stressed.  \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI     [75] 3. The periodicity of schedules laid down below apply to the majority of installations.  The \\nperiodicity may however, be mo dified by CEE, where local condition so warrants.  \\n \\n4. As regards new equipments, if schedules, have not been drawn up, tentative schedules \\nmay be evolved based on the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s guidelines and RDSO’s \\nrecommendations, keeping in the view  the local conditions also and followed with the \\napproval of CEE.  \\n \\n20322  Foot -Patrolling of OHE  \\n \\nThe object of foot -patrolling is to made visual inspection of every part of OHE (including feeder line) \\nso that any defect and abnormalities noticed are recor ded and reported to the  maintenance gangs \\nfor attention.  \\n \\n2.An experienced OHE linesman (accompanied by a Khalasi if deemed necessary by local \\nconditions) should be deputed to patrol the section on foot by day, so as to cover every part of the \\nsection inc luding years once a fortnight and suburban sections once a week.  If this patrolling is \\ndone thoroughly, many of the defects will be noticed at the incipient stage, before they develop into \\nmajor defects.  ATFO or Chargeman should foot patrol the section o nce in six months.  \\n \\n3. The Linesman on foot patrol should be equipped with signal flags, an emergency telephone \\ninstrument and essential tools required for attending to defects on the spot e.g. spanners for \\ntightening bond connections.  \\n \\n4. The Linesman on patrol  duty should particularly look for the following – \\n \\na) Chipped or damaged insulators.  \\nb) Displaced fittings and droppers  \\nc) Excessive sagging or hogging of contact wire  \\nd) Whether equalizing plate is tilted  \\ne) Free movement of auto tensioning device and position of count erweight with reference to upper \\nand lower limits of movement marked on the mast.  \\nf) Presence of protective screens, caution and warning boards and Anticlimbing devices.  \\ng)  Structural soundness of height gauges at level crossings.  \\nh) Bird nests and pieces of stray  wire likely to cause short circuits and branches of trees likely to \\ninfringe the OHE..  \\ni) Defective bonds and earth connections.  \\nj) Defects in return conductor connecting booster transformers and its connection to rails.  Oil \\nleakage if any from BT and AT.  \\nk) Any obstructions including tree branches in the way of free movement of pantograph and trains.  \\nl) Signs of heavy sparking when trains pass.  \\nm) Isolators blades being fully in and for signs of sparking or overheating of isolators as also \\ncondition of locks  \\nn) General co ndition of switching stations en -route.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS –AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUMEII      PARTI      [76] o) Tilting of masts especially on high banks and masts with sand core foundations.  \\np) Number plates  \\nq) Any other abnormal/unusual situation  \\n \\n5. Major d efects noticed by the Linesman which endanger safety shall be reported forthwith to \\nTPC through the nearest telephone.  Full details should be given to enable the TPC to decide on the \\ncourse of action to the taken and if required to regulate train movement s in the affected section.  \\n \\n6. The Linesman should himself attend to and rectify such of the minor defects (e.g. loose bond \\nconnections) which can be rectified by him on the spot without special assistance.  To facilitate this, \\nhe shall carry with him a few e ssential tools.  Other minor defects should be noted by him in his \\ndiary and entered by him in a Register (see para 20351) maintained for the purpose in the \\ndepot/sub depot.  The roster of patrolling Linesmen should  be so arranged that they will be able t o \\nreturn to the depot sub -depot for submission of report as above before going off duty for the day.  \\nWhere this is not convenient, the Linesman must report the defects on telephone to the depot/sub -\\ndepot followed by a written report in the register on the  next day .   The supervisor in charge of the \\ndepot/sub -depot will carefully  scrutinize the Register and take prompt action to rectify defects \\nreported, making suitable entries in the Register.  \\n \\n7. Testing of Emergency Telephone Sockets: During patrol duty, the Linesman will speak to \\nTPC from every emergency telephone socket in route.  Such calls from patrolling Linesmen should \\nbe recorded in a  Register by the TPC indicating the date, time and serial number/location of the \\nsocket tested.  Defective sockets s hould be reported promptly to the S&T Department for \\nrectification.  \\nA proforma  for Linemen’s Foot Patrol Report is given at Annexure3.03  \\n20323  Trolley Inspection of OHE  \\n \\nInspection  of OHE by push trolley is essential except in sections where use of trol ley is prohibited.  \\nThe object of such inspection is to enable supervisors and officers in charge of OHE maintenance to \\nobserve closely the OHE under their charge and should be carried out during day time.  The depot \\nin charge (TFO or ATFO)_ should inspect  his entire section once a month.  CTFO/AEE(TRD) should \\ninspect their respective sections once in 3/6 months respectively by push trolley or motor trolley as \\nconvenient.  Sr. DEE/DEE(TRD) also should cover his entire section at least once a year by push \\ntrolley or motor trolley.  \\n \\n2.  Apart from trolley inspection as above, officers and senior subordinates shall travel by the cabs \\nof locomotives and EMU trains as often as possible but atleast once a month to observe the general \\ncondition of OHE and to get a first hand knowledge of operating conditions.   \\n \\n20324 Current Collection Tests  \\nIt is necessary to carry out periodic tests to detect points at which contact between the contact;Are \\nand pantograph is unsatisfactory resulting In sparking. Such current coll ection tests are performed \\nat night.  \\n \\nA mirror can be fixed in front of the look -out glass of the rear cab of a locomotive and adjusted so as \\nto get a reflection of the rear pantograph which is normally in service. A person travelling in the cab \\ncan then observe through the mirror any sparking which may take place. The location where the \\nsparking is observed and the severity of the sparking should be immediately noted down and the \\nOHE at the location got checked up as soon as possible to find out and elimi nate the cause of \\nsparking.  \\n \\nThe current collection tests as above should be carried out by the depot -in-charge (TFO or ATFO) \\nonce in 3 months over his entire section. The CTFO/AEE (Trd) should accompany the depot -in-\\ncharge during such tests alternately s o as to cover their sections once in 3/6 months respectively. \\nDEE (trod) should accompany the depot -in-charge so as to cover his jurisdiction once a year.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1     [77] The form in which a record is to be m aintained Is indicated in para 20349.  \\n  \\n \\n20325 Special Checks  \\nWhile the majority of items require attention only during Annual Maintenance and Periodical \\nOverhaul, items listed below will require more frequent attention as indicated against each -  \\n \\n1.    Insulators: Generally insulators need cleaning once a year along with the annual maintenance \\nschedule. At locations subject to smoke pollution on account of steam locus or pollution due to \\nindustrial dust, the frequency of cleaning will have to be fixed based on the extent of such pollution. \\nWhere pollution is heavy, cleaning may have to be done more frequently. With the application of \\nsilicone grease, the interval for cleaning at such locations can be extended significantly.  \\n \\n2. Section Insulators: Section insulators on the main lines such as at neutral sections and \\npassenger yards should be attended to as under once in three months -  \\n(a) Clean insulators and replace badly chipped or even slightly cracked insulators.  \\n(b) Check runners for flash -marks.  \\n(c) Check le vel of the assembly and adjust as required.  \\n(d) Check foe excessive contact wire wear near anchor clamps.  \\n(e)  Tighten properly the PG clamps of droppers and stiffeners.  \\n(f) Check that pantograph passes underneath the section insulator smoothly.  \\n3    Isolat ing switches at Yards/Loading sidings: The continuity and soundness of earth connections \\nshould be  \\nchecked once a month.  \\n \\n4.    Bi -metallic clamps: These should be checked for tightness and signs of overheating once in 3 \\nmonths.  \\n5.    Earth Connections:  Apart from general inspection of bond and earthing connections during foot -\\npatrolling, all such connections should be specially checked for continuity and soundness of \\nconnections once in six months. Particulars of all earthing connections (other than str ucture bonds) \\nshould be entered in a Register station -wise for each section and the dates of six -monthly \\ninspection entered therein (see para 20351).  \\n6.    Feeders: Foot -patrolling of 25 kV feeders should be carried out every month. During this check, \\nthe Linesman shall also check that safety guards provided under the feeders properly earthed, if the \\nclearances are adequate and caution notice boards are in position.  \\n7 .   OHE supported on steel girder bridges should be examined as frequently as possible \\ndepending upon traffic conditions.  \\n8. Bird nests: Vigil should be exercised especially during the nesting season and the nests removed \\nas soon as  \\npossible.  \\n9. Pre -monsoon checks : Some of the items to be attended are -  \\ni.    Checking condition of insula tors specially that of section - Insulators at major yards having \\nmixed type of traction;  \\nii.   Over -line structures for any water leakage on the OHE and PVC insulators at major yards having \\nmixed type of traction;  \\niii.  Trimming of trees branches;  \\niv.

The aim of POH is to recondition and restore the installation in the condition it was when it was \\nfirst commissioned, whereas preventive maintenance has for its objective to take care of the wear \\nand tear during norma l service and forestalling possible failures by regular inspection and prompt \\nattention. The POH should be thorough and cover every part of the installation.  \\n \\nThe tests to be done at the time of commissioning of new OHE have been detailed in Chapter IX. \\nThe work involved during 4 -year POH is somewhat greater in scope than the pre -commissioning \\ntests, since after years of service many parts would have suffered wear and tear, of which \\nnecessary adjustments will have to be made or repairs done to make good th e wear, or the \\nirreparable items replaced.  \\n \\nThe POH of OHE should be planned on a programmed basis so that every part of the installation \\nreceives detailed attention, repair and overhaul at an interval of 4 years. For programming POH, the \\nentire section i n each Division should be divided into smaller sections. POH gangs may be provided \\nwith camps at convenient locations so that heavy materials do not have to be carried from depot or \\nsub-depot every day. Gangs can move to the site of work in convenient trai ns or by other means of \\ntransport.  \\n \\nAs far as possible, gangs for the work should be earmarked so that a uniform standard of is \\nachieved. All POH work should be done under the direct supervision of a supervisor not lower in \\nrank than an ATFO/TFO.  \\n \\nTo sum marize, the object of POH is to make a thorough inspection of the OHE and to replace such \\nof the worn - out or damaged parts by those, which have been reconditioned earlier in the \\nmaintenance depots and kept ready. The parts removed are sent to the maintena nce depots for \\ndismantling, thorough examination, re -conditioning if possible and re -assembly for use again as \\nrequired.  \\n \\nMaintenance charts, prepared in different colours may be made indicating the type of schedule each \\nsection has to undergo. The same c hart can be used to indicate the progress of work and special \\nworks to be done to exercise check over the tasks and targets.  \\n \\n2.   In addition to the items detailed under annual maintenance, the following items should be \\nattended to during POH:  \\n \\n(a) Mast s, portals and cantilever supports:  \\n(i) least one complete cantilever assembly per 10 track -km (this may be modified by CEE if \\nconsidered necessary) should be removed and taken to the,workshop for dismantling and detailed \\nexamination of various components  after thorough cleaning. This test check would reveal the extent \\nto which other cantilever assemblies have to be examined.  \\n(ii) All regulating equipment should be replaced by previously overhauled ones and the removed \\nequipment should be sent to the work shop for overhaul.  \\n(iii) As the bracket is articulated, check the position with reference to the axis of the mast. The \\nposition will vary with temperature and distance from anti -creep. The register arm and steady arm \\nshould as far as possible be in the sa me plane as the bracket.  \\n(iv) Check adjustments of cantilever assemblies, their slope and displacements at every structure \\nfor compliance with the \\'as erected\\' SEDs.  \\n \\n(b) Catenary and Contact Wires:  \\n(i) Dismantle all jumper connections, clean the conduc tors, (with emery paper in case of copper or \\nbronze conductors and metallic brush in case of aluminium conductors) clips etc. If the pieces show \\nsigns of overheating, this may be because either they are not tightened properly or the clips are \\ndeformed and  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1     [83]  contact surface is insufficient. In the latter case they should be replaced. In case of the contact wire, \\nit is the groove that has to be cleaned with either a fine metallic brush or emery pa per. The use of \\nscraper or file is forbidden. Replace frayed or damaged jumpers.  \\n \\n(i)Remove kinks if noticed.  \\n \\n(c) Insulated and Uninsulated Overlaps:  \\n \\n(i) Check the position of contact wire  respect to tracks to comply with  SEDS.  \\n \\n(ii)Ensure that insu lators of anchoring wires are crossing the plane of OHE in correct position as per \\nplan.  \\n \\n(d) Overline Structures: Check the height and gradient of the contact wire and tally the same with \\n\\'as erected\\' .  \\n \\n(e)Tunnels:  \\n \\n(1) Check the height and gradient o f the contact wire and adjust as per SED.  \\n(ii)100 per cent OHE fittings In tunnels should be replaced with new or previously over -hauled \\nfittings and the removed fittings taken to the Workshop for detailed examination.  \\n \\n(f)Turn outs:  \\n \\nCheck the position  of the contact wires with respect to the track for compliance with SED.  \\n \\n(g)Overhead Cross -feeders, Return Conductors and 25 kV Feeders:  \\n \\n(1) Examine wires for frayed strands, overheating, pinching or corrosion, especially at suspension \\nclamps and PG cl amps. Tighten junction sleeves.  \\n \\n(ii)While tightening PG clamps ensure that all joints are properly coated with veseline.  \\n \\n(iii)Check tension in wires and adjust if necessary.  \\n \\n(iv)Other overhead wires such as bypass feeders and earth -wires should be in spected. The \\ninsulator attachments should be dismantled, overhauled and put back in position. The insulators \\nshould be cleaned at the same time.  \\n \\n(h)General:  \\n \\n(i)During POH, fittings, which do not provide prescribed margin of adjustment and proper fittin g \\nshould be replaced.  \\n \\n(ii)All  fittings on masts should be checked against \"as erected\" drawings and any variation should be \\nrecorded. and reported to Sr. DEE for changing the drawings.  \\n \\n(iii)The position of splice should be recorded in the relevant lay out plans.  \\n \\n(i)Work to be done in Workshops:  \\n \\n(i) Aluminium bronze fittings, bolts and nuts should be cleaned and carefully examined if necessary \\nwith a magnifying glass. Particular care should be taken to see that the threads are in good \\ncondition. Fitt ings which have developed cracks should invariably discarded.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART     [84]  (ii) All G. I. fittings and pipes should be examined for deterioration of galvanization. Minor chippings \\nmay be repaired by using cold galvanizing paint. (Sand or emery paper should never be used for \\ncleaning).  \\n(iii) in case of a major OHE break down, it is advisable to remove the bracket assemblies in about 8 \\nto 10 spans on either side and examine them critically for cracks, twists , bends or other defects \\nwhich may cause failures later on.  \\n(iv)The regulating equipment should be dismantled and every part should be cleaned. Bearings \\nshould be fitted back after lubricating. Rubber washers/rings should be replaced where necessary. \\nAny grazing or rubbing on pulleys should either be repaired if possible or the damaged equipment \\nshould be replaced. All lubricating holes should be free for passage of grease. The stainless steel \\nrope should be closely examined for damage to the strands. Part icular attention should be given to \\nthe end fittings on the stainless steel rope. Only approved type of lubricant should be used for \\nregulating equipment components.  \\n20330 Rehabilitation of OHE  \\nDepending upon the condition of the fittings, rehabilitation  of the OHE may be undertaken after a \\nperiod of 20 year. CEE may decide the assemblies to be replaced after a special drive for condition \\nmonitoring.  \\n \\n20331 Transmission Lines  \\n1. General  \\nThe overhead lines should be inspected periodically to detect any faults and necessary repairs \\nshould be done immediately.  \\n \\n2. Patrolling of Overhead Lines from the Ground  \\nPatrolling of all overhead lines should be done before and after the monsoon. The frequency of \\npatrolling of the overhead lines for the rest of the period will depend on local conditions. The \\npatrollers should write the inspection notes and pass them on to the maintenance gang for carrying \\nout repairs. The patrollers, should be equipped with Inspection books, , tape and binoculars. The \\nmain points to be noted while patrolling are as follows:  \\n \\na) Structures: - Leaning structures; deformed members; buckled structures; missing fasteners and \\nmembers; accessories removed; protective coatings like galvanizing or paints disappeared; \\nsuspension and strain insu lator attachments damaged.  \\n \\nb) Foundations - Signs of external damage; settled and washed out soil below normal ground level \\nover foundations within uplift frustum perimeters; tilted stubs; cracks or breaks in chimney top; \\nslippage oil stubs from encasing  chimney concrete; uneven settlement of footings; disappearance of \\ngravel blanket protection; backfill embankment and its covers (rip -rap or revelment); damage to \\nretaining walls, abutments and breast walls and disappearance of external earth backing retai ning \\nwalls below designed lines.  \\n \\nc) Insulators and Fittings: - Damage to insulators, heavy surface pollution, missing locking devices \\nlike nuts, washers and pin, burnt out fittings, deflected strings, damage to protective coatings. The \\ncracked insulators,  bird droppings, dense spider webs, kites with threads hanging on the insulators \\nstring.  \\n \\nd) Conductors and Jumpers: - strands cut and opened up; loose jumpers out of shape and causing \\ninfringement of clearance of live wire to earthed metal parts, dead bir ds, fallen branches or fallen \\ntrees on conductors.  \\n \\ne) Earthing Equipment: - Damaged, broken or missing earthing strips.  \\nf) Right of Way and Clearance: - Shrubs and trees within right -of -way causing obstruction and \\ninfringe -  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION  MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART     [85] \\n rnent of clearance of bottom conductor to ground ; objects within line clearance excavation. In no \\ncircumstances, however, clearance measurements should be taken from live line.  \\n3.Foreign Objects: - Construction works near lines causing infringement in line safety or electrical \\nclearance; birds\\' nests on structures; use of structure for applying permanent support or pull to other \\nobjects; huts newly constructed underneath lines, and embankments/fencing.           -  \\n \\n3. Insp ection of Overhead Lines from Tower Tops  \\n \\nMany breakdowns including slipping of conductor due to loose clamps, cracks in insulator porcelain, \\ndefects in insulator fittings, conductor, earthwire and accessories and their attachment points on \\nstructures can  only he dispensed or seen by going on top of every structure. This inspection should \\nbe carried out by taking a shutdown of the line at least once in six years. Along with such inspection, \\nrepairs should also be carried out. Any replacement as required sh ould also be made.  \\n \\n4. Special and Emergency Inspection  \\n \\nA special inspection of the overhead lines should be carried out after severe wind/hail storms, \\nquakes, snowfalls, forest fires, floods or heavy rains. Such inspection should be done after sabotage  \\ntoo. The purpose of such inspection is to detect any damage or breakage on line and to effect \\nnecessary repairs.  \\n \\nWhen an overhead line is subject to fault often, it should be inspected to ascertain the nature of \\nfault, such as too much sag, tree branche s touching the line, etc. and to find out remedial measures \\nrequired with a view to avoiding their recurrence.  \\n \\n5. Maintenance Tests and Measurements  \\n \\nInsulation resistance of line should be measured at convenient interval particularly at the time when \\nthe line is shutdown for repairs or maintenance. In regard to measurements of earth resistance of \\nmetal structures, it should normally be carried out annually, however, local circumstances and \\nexperience may dictate increase or decrease in this interval but  it should not be less than once in \\ntwo years.  \\n \\nThe clearance and shape of the jumpers should be checked at an interval not exceeding 3 years.  \\n \\n6. Line Repairs Tools  \\n \\nThe following special tools, apart from tools required for maintenance of civil works of the lines, \\nshould be kept handy and in working order:  \\na)    Conductor jointing tools,  \\nc) Bolted come -along clamps,  \\nc)    Winches,  \\nd)  Aerial trolleys  \\n e)    Aerial rollers,  \\n  f)   Thermometers,  \\n  g)   Dynamometers ,  \\n  h)  Level and theodolite,  \\ni)Measur ing tapes  \\nk) Linesman\\'s ratchet,  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS  - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [861  m)Pull -lift device of adequate capacity,  \\nn)Wire ropes , and  \\np) Spanners  \\n \\nIV. SAFETY RULES FOR OHE  \\n20332 General  \\n \\n1.   The following rules are supplementary to the General and Subsidiary Rules and the instructions \\ncontained In Volume 1.  \\n \\n2.   Printed boards containing instructions regarding treatment of persons suffering from electric \\nshock should be exhibited in every OHE maintenance depot, equipment room, s witching station, \\ncabin, OHE Inspection Car shed, loco shed, OHE Inspection Car and wiring train and also in offices \\nof SM, ASM, CYM, AYM and HTXR.  \\n \\n3.   First Aid Boxes should be kept at every switching station, maintenance depot, in OHE Inspection \\nCar, breakdown vehicle and wiring train.                                                             1  \\n \\n4.   Ropes, come -along clamps, tirfor etc. should be tested once in  six months at least, in the \\npresence of an ATFO, and record of such tests maintained in each depot.  \\n \\n20333 Documents to be kept with OHE Supervisors for Work on OHE  \\n \\n1.   The ATFO (OHE) or other official supervising OHE work shall have with him a complete set of \\nstructure erection drawings, lay out plans, sectioning\\' diagram and general sup ply diagram etc. \\npertaining to the overhead equipment under his charge. He shall also have with him Station Working \\nRules for the stations between which he is working. He shall, in addition, keep with him all useful \\ninformation regarding the running of tra ins over his section.  \\n \\n2.    It shall be the responsibility of the TFO/ ATFO (OHE) or in his absence the senior -most official \\nin-charge of the work to ensure that all safety rules prescribed are actually observed by the staff \\nwhen carrying out work on tra ction installations. It shall be the duty of the supervisor to remind the \\nstaff periodically of the various safety rules to be observed at work site.  \\n \\n20334 Permit to Work  \\n \\nBefore commencing work on any part of the dead OHE or within 2m of live OHE, a pe rmit-to-work \\nshall be obtained from TPC or other authorized person as detailed in Chapter VI.  \\n \\n20335 protection of Staff against Traffic Movements and Protection of Trains  \\n \\n1.   The supervisory official in -charge of work on OHE shall observe relevant pro visions of GR and \\nSR for protection of trains before work on OHE is  commenced and for the whole time the work is in \\nprogress.  \\n \\n2.   Measures laid down in the Chapter VI shall be observed by all concerned to prevent accidental \\nenergization of the section u nder power block on account of electric train movements.  \\n \\n20336 Earthing before Commencement of Work  \\n \\n1  All metallic parts within reach (either directly or through tools etc.) shall be earthed, after they are \\nmade dead.  \\n \\n2.   Each working party shall b e protected by at least two independent earths, one on each side of a \\nworking party.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART     [87] 3.   If the distance between the working parties exceeds 100m intermediate earths shall be provided \\nin such a  manner as to ensure that the distance between earths does not exceed 100m.  \\n \\n \\n4.   Even when earthing is provided by isolator switches with earthing heels, additional temporary \\nearths as above shall also be provided.  \\n \\n20337 Procedure for Providing Tempor ary Earths  \\n \\nThe following sequence of operations shall be carried out while providing temporary earths on OHE  \\n \\n1.   Men shall be posted on both sides of the site of work to warn the working party of any \\napproaching train on the same track and adjacent tr ack(s).  \\n2.   The permit -to-work shall be obtained prior to commencing work to make sure that power supply \\nhas been switched off.  \\n3.   For providing temporary earth on the OHE or other equipment after it has been made dead, only \\ndischarge/ earthing pole a ssembly specially designed for this purpose alone should be used. The \\ncable shall be flexible and should have adequate cross -section (40 mm\\') to be able to withstand \\nshort circuit currents.  \\n4.   Fix the earthing -clamp securely to a mast at least one span away on one side of the work site \\nafter making sure that the mast -to-earth rail bond of this mast is intact. Alternatively, the clamp may \\nbe fixed to the bottom flange of one of the traction rails, taking the cable under the rails.  \\n \\nIn single -rail track -circuited sections, the earthing clamp should be fixed to the traction rail i.e. non -\\ntrack -circuit rail; on double -rail track -circuited sections the earthing clamp should be fixed to the \\nmast.  \\n \\nThe mast -end or rail -end clamp of the discharge /earthing pole  assembly should be checked for \\ntightness just before connecting the top clamp on to the OHE as the earthing clamp fixed to the rail \\nor mast in advance could have worked loose.  \\n \\n5.   Hook securely with a snap action the top clamp of discharge/ earthing po le assembly to the \\nOHE conductor close to the mast/structure and tie the earthing pole to the mast/structure. Never \\nhook on the top hook of the earthing cable to the OHE, till the other end has been first connected to \\nearth.  \\n6.   The earthing clamps shoul d always be fixed to the traction rail or mast / structure first and then \\nthe top clamp should be hooked to the OHE to be earthed.  \\n7. Repeat operations 4 and 5 for the second temporary earth on the other side of the working party.  \\n8.   After temporary ea rths have been fixed on the OHE on both sides of the work site, staff may \\nproceed with the maintenance work.  \\n9. After work is completed and men, materials and tools have been removed and the OHE is clear, \\nthe above earthing rods may be removed in the reve rse order i.e., first remove the hook on the OHE \\nand then the clamp fixed to the rail or mast/structure. After warning all staff that supply will  be \\nrestored and that they should keep away from live equipment, the permit -to-work may be returned \\nand supply  restored.  \\n \\n20338 Precautions in Regard to Discharge/Earthing Pole Assembly  \\n \\n1.   The continuity of the cable connection between the top clamp and the earthing clamp should be \\nchecked once a fortnight.  \\n \\nCable should be renewed if more then 20% strands a re broken. During use, cable should be \\ncontinually examined for fraying and breakage of strands.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1     [88] Discharge/Earthing pole assembly should be Inspected by TFO/ATFO once a month.  \\n \\n2.   During accidents when slewing the OHE and in similar circumstances, the discharge/ earthing \\npole assembly should be provided at a location where it is  not likely to be interfered with during \\ncrane working or due to work on the permanent way.  \\n \\n20339 Work on OHE o r any Conductor having a Sectioning Point  \\n \\nWhen work is to be carried out on OHE or conductors, which are not electrically bonded, following \\nadditional precautions are required.  \\n \\ni) The two sections of conductors or ends of conductor  which may have snap ped may be at \\ndifferent potentials. Each end should, therefore, be separately earthed at two points after switching \\noff supply to both parts,of the OHE or conductor.  \\n11) This precaution should also be observed when working on or in the vicinity of a secti oning point \\nand cut -in insulators.  \\n \\n3.   Neutral Sections should be treated as live equipment and earthed separately at two points on \\neither side of the work party before commencing work.  \\n \\n4. , When work is to be carried out on an isolator, both sides of  the isolator should be earthed at two \\npoints or more conveniently, isolator jumpered temporarily.  \\n \\n20340 Protective Helmets  \\n \\nAt the work -site, staff  are advised to wear helmets to protect their heads against any tools or \\nequipment which may drop down a ccidentally, as well as to minimize head injury  in case of \\naccidental fall from a height.  \\n \\n20341 Safety Belt  \\n \\nStaff working on structures or a ladder are advised to protect themselves against an inadvertent fall \\nby wearing a safety belt for supporting th emselves by a rope sling.  \\n \\n20342 Rules for use of Ladders  \\n1.    It shall be the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that ladders are stored in a protected \\nenclosure, properly maintained and reconditioned as often as required.  \\n \\nA ladder should nev er be in such a position so as to likely to fall on a live part.  \\n \\n2.    Ropes used with ladders should be of cotton or jute. Use of metallic ropes is prohibited. A \\nladder should be held by one person on the ground to prevent slipping, while the top end sh ould be \\ntied to the supporting structure or conductor to keep.lt in position and prevent it sliding away.  \\n3.   Ladders should never be allowed to fall on or rest against the contact wire.  \\n4.   If the nature of the work involves risk of the conductor brea king into two parts (due to opening \\nout of sleeves or splices) the ladder shall not be rested against the conductor. Trolley ladders shall \\nbe used in such cases.  \\n5. More than one person shall not normally be allowed on a ladder as far as possible.  \\n6.   Climbin g on a ladder with wet or slippery foot -wear is forbidden.  \\n7.  Ladders should not be used for transporting materials.  \\n8.   A rope should be used to pass tools or any equipment to the men working on a ladder.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11  PART     [89]  \\n 9. No one should stand directly below a work spot under a ladder.  \\n \\n20343 Other Important Precautions to be taken while Carrying out Works on OHE  \\n \\n1 The useful cross section of a conductor shall not he reduced while making joints.  \\n \\n2. An y contact with conductors, which are not specifically earthed, is forbidden.  \\n \\n3. The strength of the anchoring rope should be not less than that of the cable to be anchored.  \\n \\n4.   Temporary anchoring of conductors should only be done by using stranded fl exible steel cable at least of \\nthe same tensile strength as the cable to be anchored. Use of two cables of different strengths joined together \\nis prohibited. Use of cotton, jute or other non -metallic ropes for anchoring is forbidden.  \\n \\n6.   Structure bonds  and cable connections of the structure to earth shall be maintained in proper condition. \\nNo heavy materials should be stacked on the rail bonds; transverse bonds between two rails of the same \\ntrack as well as rails of different tracks shall also be mainta ined in proper condition.  \\n \\n7.   Where rails to which structures are connected are replaced, the structure shall be connected to the new \\nrail immediately after it has been laid.  \\n \\n20344 Procedure for Effecting Shut -Down for Work on Auxiliary Transformers  \\n \\nPower supply to auxiliary transformers is effected through fuse -switches on the 25 kV side and the LT Side is \\ncontrolled through fuses or double -pole iron -clad switch -fuses. Isolating fuse switches should be opened out \\nand fuses removed both on the HT and  LT sides and the transformer earthed before starting work.  \\n \\n20345 Work on Overhead lines Running Parallel to Electrified Tracks  \\n \\nNo work on any span of any overhead line (LT power line or other line) running parallel to an electrified track \\nwhere the mi nimum distance between the nearest conductor of the overhead line and the centre -line of the \\nnearest electrified track is less than 8m, should be done without switching off power from the 25 kV traction \\nline (in addition to making dead and earthing the ove rhead line on which work is to be carried out, in the \\nnormal manner) excepting for the following specific items for work :  \\n1 .   Replacement of lamps, if below line.  \\n2 .   Painting of structures / poles upto a distance of 2m from the live wires of the po wer line.  \\n3 .   Reinforcement of foundations where such reinforcement does not involve any prior weakening of the  \\n        foundation at any time during the work.  \\n 4.    Replacement of aerial fuses.  \\n \\n20346 Isolation of Booster Transformers  \\n \\nTo isolate a  booster transformer for maintenance or other work, the following sequence of operations should \\nbe carried out  \\n1.   Where no isolator is provided a permit -to-work should be obtained for both the elementary sections, the \\nBT should be disconnected from the OHE and the OHE made through by jumpering.  \\n2.   When an isolator is provided to disconnect the BT primary winding from 25 kV lines, power must be \\nswitched off from both the elementary sections to which the BT is connected after which the isolator should b e \\nopened to disconnect the BT from the OHE and to make the OHE through.  \\n3.   The secondary winding of the BT should be disconnected from the return conductor and the return \\nconductor made through by jumpering.  \\n4 .  The return conductor should be earthed at the location where the BT has been disconnected; and the mid -  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART      [90]  point rail links on both sides of the BT should be opened so that booster cells on either side will \\nextend over a longer section temporarily.  \\n5. With the OHE and return conductors made through, 25 kV power supply may be restored  \\n \\nIt should be noted that during the period when a BT has been disconnected from service, the \\ninterference on adjacent communication circuits will be enhanced. In view of this the defective BT \\nshould be replaced with a good BT with the least possible delay.  \\n \\n20347 Isolators  \\n \\nIsolating Switches on the 25 kV system shall not be opened or closed when current is passing \\nthrough them. Normally, isolator s should only be opened or closed, after power supply to the section \\nhas been switched off by opening the appropriate interruptor (see para 20600 & 20601).  \\n \\n20348 Petroleum Sidings  \\n \\nThe following arrangements/precautions would be necessary: -  \\n \\nArrangeme nts  \\n \\ni) An equipotential link between the petroleum sidings installation earth and the track via a switch  \\nii) Setting up of neutral zones (insulating joints) in the track to avoid any risk of propagating stray \\ncurrent.  \\niii) Setting up of neutral zones/se ctions in the contact wire similar to loco inspection pits.  \\niv) The tracks must be provided with longitudinal bonds on both the rails as well as transverse bond  \\n     (30 m intervals). All masts and metallic structures in the vicinity of the track/ siding s should be \\nprovided with structure bonds. Copper rivets should be used for bonding.  \\nv)10 ohm earths must be connected to the petroleum siding on each side at the insulated joint.  \\n \\nPrecautions  \\nc) No oil tanker Is. permitted to stable under live OHE for ins pection purpose.  \\nii) Fuelling to be done by side filling arrangement only.  \\niii) Pipe lines in the vicinity of the track should be properly earthed.  \\niv) Minimum 2 m electrical clearance from live OHE of the adjacent track or only other structure \\nnearby m ust be maintained.  \\nv) During filling/loading and unloading of petroleum products the isolators at the neutral section of \\nOHE should be kept open to ensure that the OHE is dead and earthed.  \\n \\nV. FORMS AND REGISTERS  \\n20349 Records to be Maintained  \\n \\nIn Chapt er VI the recommended proforma for Power Block and Permit -to-Work messages have \\nbeen given.  \\n \\nParticulars of other essential records to be maintained in regard to OHE maintenance are given \\nbelow  \\n \\n1.

The RCC includes the main control \\nroom, equipment room, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) room, Remote Control laboratory and \\nBattery Room and is the nerve centre of the Tract ion Power Control.  \\n \\n \\nTypes Of Equipment:  \\n \\nThe following types of Remote Control Equipment are mainly in use on Indian Railways at present:  \\n \\n(i) Frequency Modulated Voice Frequency Telegraph (FMVFT), Strowger type equipment for \\nsupervisory control.  \\n \\n(ii) Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with Microprocessor based \\nequipment and/or Computer based equipment.  \\n \\nThe FMVFT equipment was in use for all electrification schemes prior to 1980. Being mainly all relay \\nsystem, the equipment has  become outdated although some Remote Control Centres still continue \\nto operate on this system. Salient features of the system are indicated at paras 20401 to 20406.  \\n \\nThe SCADA equipment based on State of the art technology has come into use after 1980. \\nConsidering the fast growth and development of computer based equipment, newer types with \\nenhanced capabilities and new makes are being introduced. Addional facilities at each new RCC is \\nalso natural as new features get incorporated.  \\n \\n11. FMVFT EQUIPMENT  \\n \\n20401 Transmission Path  \\n \\nFor transmitting control signals from the Remote Control Centre (RCC) to the various controlled \\nposts underground cable circuits suitable for voice frequency (VF) operation are employed. These \\nconsist of star quads with an attenua tion of about 0. 3 dB/km. Isolating transformers are provided on \\nthe cable circuits at Intervals of 10 to 15 km to limit the build up of longitudinal induced voltage on \\naccount of induction effect of single 25kV ac traction. Line losses are made good by VF  repeaters \\nprovided by the S&T Department at interval of 30 to 50 km. The maximum gain in the repeater is 20 \\ndB. Depending upon the distance of the RCC or controlled post (TSS/SP/SSP), repeater gain is so \\nset that signal level at any point is within prescr ibed limit. Impedance matching transformers of ratio \\n1120 : 1120 are provided at points where communication cable is tapped for taking connection to \\nthe R.C. Centre or to the controlled posts. Suitable surge arresters are also provided inside the \\nequipment  room at the termination point of communication cable to protect the circuits.  \\n \\nNormally three pairs of conductors are earmarked for Remote Control System, one pair reserved for \\ntelecommand signals from RC Centre to the posts and one pair from the posts t o RC centre for \\ntelesignals. The third pair is spare for use in emergency, when any one of the other two pairs \\nbecome unhealthy.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1   [109]   \\n 20402 Remote Control Switching Equipment  \\nThe RCC switching  equipment consists of the following five major units  \\n \\n1..Pulse Generator  \\n2. Send Selector Circuit,  \\n3.Receive Selector Circuit,  \\n4.Check Circuit and  \\n5. Indication Circuit.  \\n \\nAll the units are of the plug -in-type and are housed inside the steel cabinet, w hich is provided with \\ndust proff front and back doors. A number of such cabinets are provided in the remote control centre \\ndepending upon the number of controlled posts in a section.  \\n \\n20403 Mimic Diagram Board at RCC  \\n \\nThe mimic diagram board at the RCC c omprises several control panels on which the mimic diagram \\nis shown. Every apparatus to be remote controlled is represented on this mimic diagram board by a \\ncontrol discrepancy switch. Hand operated dummy switches similar to but clearly distinguishable \\nfrom the control discrepancy switches are provided to represent certain non -remote controlled \\napparatus like sub -station isolat,1 ,. The electrified tracks are represented on the mimic diagram by \\nwhite perspex strips or metallic strips. Whenever the 2SkV volt age on any portion of the OHE \\nbetween two controlled posts fails, or is not available, the corresponding portion of the mimic \\ndiagram lights up. The mimic diagram, however, remains dark under normal working conditions.  \\n \\nEach control discrepancy switch inc ludes a built -in-jamp in a central indicator\\'bar. If the controlled \\nequipment is in closed position, the central indicator bar shows continuity of the diagram. If it is \\nopen, the central indicator bar will be at right angles, breaking the continuity of dia gram.  \\n \\nBesides.above, fault annunciation vandows on the mimic diagram board are provided for each \\ncontrolled post, with suitable inscription to annunciate the following kinds of fault:  \\n \\n1 Station Blocked  \\n \\n2.R.C. Equipment Defective  \\n \\n3.Contact Failure  \\n \\n4.Low volt d. c.  \\n \\n5.240 V a.c. Failure  \\n \\n6. Transformer Alarms  \\n7. Transformer faults  \\n8.Low Volt 110V/72V d.c.  \\nItem 6,7,8 are provided only for traction sub -stations. Item 6&7 are provided separately for each \\nindividual transformer.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAY S-AC TRACTIO MANUAL -VOLUME II PART I      110 20404 FMVFT Equipment  \\nThe control signals from the RCC as well as indication signals from the various controlled posts are \\ntransmitted on separate channels within the voice frequency range of 420 to 2460 Hz. at  a \\ntransmission speed of 50 baud, with a 120 Hz separation between the channels. Only 18 channels \\nare thus available for use. Frequency modulation is employed. The oscillator unit on the transmitter \\nmodulates the frequency + 30 Hz (for \\'mark\\') -30 Hz (for \\'space\\') of the channel frequency.  \\n \\nThe transmitting level of each channel is -22dB across 1120 Ohm. The normal receiving level can \\nbe, between, -22 dB and a minimum level of -30 dB.  \\n \\nDue to availability of only 18 channels within the voice frequency ran ge of 420 to 2460Hz. with \\nchannel separation of 120 Hz each pair of conductor can control upto 18 independent of grouped \\nstations, where the number of such stations exceeds 18, one more pair would be required for \\npurposes of telesignals only.  \\n \\n20405 Frequ ency Allocation  \\n \\nIn view of their operational importance, all the feeding and sectioning posts are controlled \\nindependently by using a separate frequency channel for transmission of telecommands and \\ntelesignals to/from each post. For purposes of telecomma nd only SSPs are grouped (not more than \\n3) in order to economize in the number of channels. Telecomn -iands for all the posts in the same \\ngroup are transmitted on the same frequency channels. However, the individual controlled post in a \\ngroup is  identified by inserting a code in the shape of a long pulse or a long pause in the impulse \\ntrain generated by the pulse generator in the switching equipment. When posts are grouped as \\nexplained above, only one operation at a time can be carried out in the grouped pos ts from the \\nRCC.  \\n \\n20406 Controlled Post Equipment  \\n \\nThe switching and FMVFT equipment at each controlled post are housed in one steel cabinet with \\ndust proof doors. The switching equipment is similar to that provided at the RCC.  \\n \\nThe FMVFT equipment has one send channel panel and one receive channel panel. The equipment \\nworks on 24V dc battery power supply. All the panels except the termination panel are of plug -in-\\ntype An amplifier is provided with attenuation pads for level adjustment. The channel panel s are of \\nthe same type as those in the RCC.  \\n \\nIII. SCADA EQUIPMENT  \\n20407 General  \\n \\nThe SCADA equipment at the RCC is called master Station while that of the controlled station is \\nreferred to as Remote Terminal Unit (RTU).  \\n \\n20408 Transmission Path  \\n \\nUnderg round telecommunication trunk cable is provided for transmitting the signals from and to the \\nRCC and the controlled Remote Terminal Units (RTU). Three pairs of conductors (One pair for \\n\"Send\", one pair for “ receive\" and the third as spare) from this cable  are made available for remote \\ncontrol operation.  \\n \\n20409 Isolating Transformers  \\n \\nTo limit the build up of longitudinal induced voltage on account of induction effects of 25 kV traction, \\nisolating transformers are provided on the cable circuit at interval s of 10 to 15 km. The cable is \\ntapped at the RCC and each controlled station and 3 pairs of conductors are terminated on a \\nterminal board. Isolating transformer of impedance ratio 1120 :1120 is provided at the point of \\ntapping.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACT ION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    111  20410 Repeater Stations .  \\n \\nVoice frequency repeaters are provided at intervals of 40 -50 km to boost the signal and to make \\ngood the line attenuation. The amplifier gain at the repeater station is about 20 dB, with an equ alizer \\nincorporated to compensate upto 0.02 dB/kHz/km. Depending upon the distance,.the repeater gain \\nis set so that the signal level at any point en -route is within certain prescribed limits.  \\n \\nIf the lead is long suitable surge arresters are provided ins ide the equipment room to protect the \\ncircuits. The metallic sheath of the lead in cable shall also be kept insulated from the earth system \\nof the switching station to prevent induction effect, the insulated conductor alone being led into \\ncontrol panels. F or the same reason, switching station earthing, LT 240 V auxiliary transformer \\nneutral earthing and earth of R. C. equipment are all kept separate and distinct and are NOT \\ninterconnected. In addition, the switching station structure should be solidly bonde d to the track rails \\nby two independent connections.  \\n \\n20411 Microwave Communication  \\nIn some of the sections on Indian Railways dedicated Microwave channel at carrier frequency of 18 \\nGHz has been provided for the purpose of communication.  \\n \\n20412 Optical Fiber Cable  \\nOptical fibre cable has also been introduced for communication in some sections of Indian Railways, \\nwhich is also used for RC equipment.  \\n \\nDetails of the interface between the latest communication systems and the RCC/RTU equipment \\nmay be seen in the relevant technical documents.  \\n \\n20413 Master Station Equipment  \\nHardware Configuration: Dual main micro -computer/mini -computer system, one main and the other \\nhot stand - by, is provided at the rnaster -station, each system interfaces with its front en d \\nprocessors, if any, and modem for communication with RTUs and with the man -machine interface \\nequipment to provide up -to-date network data and to accept commands. Each system has its own \\nsystem console and hard and floppy disks along with their drives. Wa tch dogs are provided for \\nmonitoring the health of the computer system. In case of failure of one computer system, the \\nstandby system takes over automatically.  \\n \\nTwo data -logging printers, one on -line and other as standby, are provided, both being connecte d to \\nthe same on - line computer system. In case of failure of one printer, the other printer automatically \\ntakes over.  \\nMan-Machine -Interface : Work Stations  \\n \\nTwo work -stations, one for each of the two operators, each consisting of two semi -graphic colour  \\nVisual Display Units (VDUS) and a key -board are provided \\'at the RCC. The key board contains \\nboth functional keys for operations that are repeated frequently and alpha -numeric key for input of \\nnumerical data and text.  \\n \\nBoth workstations are connected to the same on -line computer and meet the following \\nrequirements..  \\n \\n(i)Normally control pre -defined and physically demarcated sections.  \\n(ii)In case of complete outage of one workstation, all of its functions can be transferred to the \\nhealthy workstation, so  that normal operations can continue.  \\n(iii)Normally one VDU Is on line and the other acts as standby at each work station. However, if so \\nneeded, it is possible to have both VDUs of each work station on lines simultaneously, either of the \\ntwo VDUs being u sed for viewing diagram for telecontrol purposes and the other for viewing alarm, \\non-demand trend curves, histograms or any  other data.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     112 20414 Mimic Diagram Board (MDB)  \\nA mimic diagram board a nd its associated mimic driver is provided at the RCC. The MDB depicts \\nthe traction power supply diagram, Indicating the energize/de -energize condition of the sub -sectors \\nof the catenary, status of the interruptors and CBs at TSS & FP, SSP and SP.  \\nUnlike in the conventional Mimic Diagram Board used in RCCs prior to introduction of SCADA \\nsystem (see para 20403) all control operations are carried out from the key board(s) provided at the \\nworkstations. The Mimic Diagram Boards sole purpose is, therefore, to g ive an overall view of the \\ntraction power supply system to the operator. Size of the MDB is, therefore, very much smaller. It is \\nthe intention to do away with the MDB altogether since the system can be viewed in the VDUS.  \\n \\n20415 Annunciations  \\nControlled Station  \\n\"Remote Station Defective\" is annunciated by a LED.  \\nMaster Station  \\nThe following annunciations by LEDs are provided on the MDB.  \\n (i)       Main System \"ON\"  \\n(i) Standby System \"ON\"  \\n(iii)     Main System Defective  \\n(ii) Standby System Defective  \\n(v)       Main UPS Failed  \\n(vi) Standby UPS Failed  \\n(vii) UPS battery low (below 90% of nominal voltage)  \\n(viii)     415 V, ac, 3 Ph, supply to UPS failed  \\n \\n20416 SCADA Software  \\n \\nThe operating system used is suitable for multi -user, multi - tasking, net working and real time \\napplic ations.  \\n \\n20417 VDU Display  \\n \\nThe, application software supports a large number of versatile serni -graphic coloured displays for \\nissuing telecommands, blocking/deblocking the controlled points, viewing alarm listing, event listing \\nor for carrying out speci al functions. For details of these displays, manufacturers Operating Manual \\nmay be referred to. Calling any of the VDU displays is by simple keyboard operation by the \\noperator, with pre -defined options available for the order and manner in which displays a re called.                                                \\n \\n20418 Transmission and Coding System  \\n \\nThe master station equipment normally scans continuously all the RTUs in a pre -defined cyclic \\nsequence, to update the equipment status, alarms, events and me asurands. Exchange of \\ninformation between Master Station and RTUs takes place on interrogation by master followed by \\nreply from RTU. The communication technique is based on Digital Address Time Division \\nMultiplexing. Every data exchange is based on well de fined transmission protocol. Each transmitted \\nInformation contains sufficient parity cheek bits to detect transmission errors.  \\n \\n20419 Historical Data Storage  \\n \\nThe SCADA system is designed to cater for historical data storage of traction power supply syst em \\ndata for a period of one year. This includes:  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [113)  (i)All alarms./events / measurands of controlled stations and all system alarms.  \\n(ii_)Day wise storage of average feeder current and volta ge during the day, maximum demand, \\nmaximum and minimum feeder voltage in the 25 kV side, total number of operations of feeder \\nprotective relays viz. OCR, DPR and WPC relays, CB trappings and maximum and minimum OHE \\nvoltage on both sides of the neutral sect ion. A memory capacity of 40 MB is provided for this \\npurpose in the hard disk, with provision for further expansion of the memory as required.  \\n  \\n20420 UPS and Batteries at RCC  \\n \\nDual Stand -alone UPS System of adequate capacity to supply 240 V a. c. 50 Hz single phase \\nsupply to the SCADA system at Master Station is provided.  \\n \\nBoth the UPS work in parallel sharing the load. In case of failure of one, the entire load is \\nautomatically taken over by the healthy UPS without affecting the working of the system.  \\n \\nin case of outage of both the UPS at the same time, the load of SCADA equipment is directly \\nconnected to input mains through a static switch without any break.  \\n \\nA single battery is provided with both the UPS  with adequate Ah capacity to provide 2 h sup ply to \\nvarious equipments in case of failure of input 415 V ac. 50 Hz supply.  \\n \\n20421 Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)  \\n \\nThe RTU is microprocessor based and includes its associated digital Input/output modules, alarm \\ninput modules, analog input modules, watchdog  transducers, memory modules, interposing relays, \\nsummation CTs, power supply unit(s), surge arresters and other items necessary for its proper \\nworking.  \\n \\n20422 Storage of Events and Alarms  \\n \\nAll changes (one or more) in the status of the CBS/interruptors / motor -operated isolators and \\nalarms that may occur between consecutive polling are stored by RTU until they are reported to the \\nmaster station. This is to eliminate any loss in reporting to the master station due to intermittent \\nfailures of channel or an y other reason. In other words, no event is lost without its being reported to \\nmaster station.  \\n \\n20423 SCADA Equipment Capacity  \\n \\nThe SCADA equipment is generally designed for the following tele commands, telesignals and \\ntelemetered parameters for a typica l TSS, SP & SSP of a double line section:  \\n \\nS.NO.   CONTROLLED   STATION   TELECOMMAND  TELESIGNAL   MEASURANDS  \\n1.    TSS     24   64   8 \\n2.    SP     8   12   4 \\n3.    SSP     8   12   - \\n \\nNumber of controlled stations (TSS, SP, SSPS) to be controlled from an RCC mal l be as per the \\nrequirements of the section.  \\nSpeed of Transmission and Update Time  \\nThe communication between the master station and the RTUs is at a suitable transmission speed \\nnot exceeding 600 baud. Normal polling time for updating status, alarm and me asurands for the \\ndesigned capacity is not more than 4 sec for 20 controlled stations and not more then 6 sec for 30 \\ncontrolled stations. The actual timings may slightly vary depending on communication protocol \\nadopted and the system design.  \\nNDIAN RAILWAYS  - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [114]  The RCC should be in the middle of the electrif led section if the number of controlled stations \\nexceeds 30 so that scanning on either side is possible and update time. kept to the minimum.  \\n \\n20424 Modems  \\n \\n(i) The modems (modulator/ demodulators) provided for communication between the master station \\nand the RTUs utilize frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation and include send, receive and timing \\nfunctions. The send and receive functions are independently prog rammed as required. The modem \\nworks satisfactorily upto an input signal level of -45 dBm.  \\n(ii)The modem also incorporates necessary amplifier having a minimum gain of 30 db to \\ncompensate for any signal variation at different points in the system. Suitable  attenuation Is \\nprovided within the amplifiers to adjust the level through trimpot/rotary switch. It has an output signal \\nlevel adjustable between 0 and -30 d bm in steps of 1 dbrn.  \\n \\n20425 Special Features in SCADA Equipment  \\n \\nThe following additional fea tures are incorporated in the SCADA equipment:  \\n(I).   Tripping of bridging interrupters on under voltage at SP in extended feed condition.  \\n(I!)   Inter .lock release request facility for circuit breakers/interruptors control at boundary post (for \\nguideli nes for these inter locks see RDSO\\'s letter No. ETI/PSI/RC/SPEC.19 dated 10.3.1989).  \\n(iii)  Control of shunt capacitor bank and monitoring of power factor.  \\n(!v)   Automatic localization of fault on OHE and isolation of faulty sub -sector.  \\n \\nSCADA systems on Indian Railways are being supplied by various manufacturers. Although the \\nsystems are different, the basic features of the systems are similar. For details of operating \\ninstructions and maintenance, the operating technical manuals of the makers should b e referred to.  \\n \\nIV.

There shall be shifts in each of which there will \\nbe at least one Traction Power Controller (TPC) who shall be in charge and, depending upon the \\nworkload, an Assistant Traction Power Controller (ATPC) to assist him. The CTPC will be directly \\nresponsible for the correctness of all -switching operations and entries in the LogBook. No person is \\npermitted to operate the control switches except with the specific perm ission and knowledge of \\nCTPC. No person shall be permitted to work as a TPC or ATPC, unless so authorized In writing by \\nSR.DEE (TrD).  \\n \\n20502 Knowledge of Rules  \\n \\nTPC (and ATPC where provided) shall be fully conversant at all times with the rules and regul ations \\nlaid down by the Administration as well as with the details of the electrical distribution system. He \\nshall keep all instructions issued from time to time as well as copies of documents like General and \\nSubsidiary Rules, Station Working Rules etc. r eady at hand. He shall keep all books and records \\nup-to-date, posting all correction slips on the day of receipt in the appropriate document.  \\n \\n20503 Entry into RCC  \\n \\nNo person is permitted to enter the TPC unless he has an authority for the purpose. The T PC and \\nATPC who are on duty shall not be disturbed or distracted.  \\n \\n20504 Shift Duty  \\n \\nNo interchange of shift duty or variation of hours shall be permitted without the specific sanction of \\nDEE/AEE (TrD). In case of unavoidable circumstances the staff may make the necessary \\narrangement with other shift duty staff before approaching AEE (TrD) for permission. No one shall \\nleave his post of duty until he is relieved by an authorised person.  \\n \\n20505 Shift Duty Register,  \\n \\nA shift Duty Register shall be maintain ed in which shall be noted every change of shift duty. Before \\nhanding over charge, the outgoing TPC shall. record in the Shift Duty Register all points (shut \\ndowns, power blocks, defects in plant, any special instructions received, pending message, if any \\netc.) requiring the attention of the TPC who takes over. Before taking over of a, shift duty, the TPC \\nshall scrutinize all the entries recorded during the previous shift in the Shift Duty Register a.,jJ in the \\nlog book, study the entire mimic diagram in th e presence of the previous shift TPC and clear all \\npoints of doubt, if any. He should then sign with time in the Shift Duty Register, thereby admitting \\nhaving taken over correctly and assuming full responsibility from then onwards.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - A,; TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    [l18]  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 20506 Repair and Adjustment of RC Equipment  \\n1.   TPC shall not repair, adjust or any way interfere with any of the RC equipment at the RCC \\nexcept for carrying out switching operations. Every defect shall  be reported at once to the Chief \\nTraction Foreman (Remote Control) or the Assistant Traction Foreman (Remote Control), who are \\nresponsible for the maintenance work.  \\n \\n2.   No work may be commenced by any person on remote control or power supply equipment at the \\nRCC or any controlled post without prior intirnation to and approval of the TPC on duty, who shall \\nrecord the event in the Log Book. At the end of the work, the TPC should test the equipment on \\nremote control and satisfy himself that everything is i n order.  \\n \\n20507 Switching Operations to he Deliberate  \\n \\nSince all circuit breakers and interruptors are operated through remote control, the TPC will have \\ncontrol over the switching operations over a wide area. The time required for each operation is of \\nthe order of only a few seconds. Every switching opration should, therefore, be carried out only after \\ndue thought and deleberation. Operation of several switches simultaneously should be avoided as \\nfar as possible as it may lead to wrong operations.  \\n \\n2050 8 Liaison with Section Controller  \\n \\nWhile the Section Controller is directly in charge of all movements of trains, TPC is directly \\nresponsible for maintaining the power supply for ali\\' electrified tracks. For operation of the train \\nservices, it is necessar y that the close liaison be maintained between the Section Controller and the \\nTPC at all, times. The particulars of communication facilities provided for this purpose have been \\ndescribed in Chapter 11 of Vol 1.  \\n \\nThe TPC should also be in touch with the op erators at the various Grid Substations.  \\n \\n20509 Prompt Attention to Telephone Calls  \\n \\nEither TPC or the ATPC shall attend promptly to all calls received on any of the telephones at the \\nRCC, priority however being given to emergency telephone and TPC telep hone.  \\n \\n20510 Log Book  \\n \\nThe Log Book is a primary minute -to-minute record of every switching operation carried out at the \\nRCC, every interruptions to power supply, unusual or abnormal occurrences, messages received \\nover the telephones, special instruction s received from superior officers, defects reported in \\nequipment and action taken to have them rectified as and when they occur, in chronological order.  \\n \\n20511 Movements of Maintenance Staff  \\n \\nIt is also the duty of the TPC to keep a track of the movement s of all maintenance staff of the \\nTraction Distribution Branch so that in an emergency he is in a position to summon the nearest \\ngang/person, as required. It is primarily the duty of the maintenance staff to keep the TPC informed \\nof their movements - which  shall be recorded in a \"Register of staff movements.\"  \\n \\n20512 Checking of Time   \\n \\nThe TPC shall check the correctness of the time on the clock at 1600 h of each day when time \\nsignal is received from the Traffic Control Office.  \\n \\n20513 Alarm Circuits  \\n \\nAt every change of shift, the TPC taking over shall cheek all the alarm circuits and carry out a lamp \\ntest of the mimic diagram panel wherever this facility exists.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [119]  20514 Emergency Generator Set   \\nA 415/24OV, ac, 50 Hz, 3 phase Diesel Engine Driven Generator Set is provided at each RCC for \\nfeeding of the essential loads in the event of failure of the rnains supply. Each TPC and ATPC shall \\nbe fully conversant with the starting of the Generator Set.  It shall be started and worked for an hour \\nat least once a week if it has not been operated due to failure of mains supply.  \\n \\n20515 Duties of Chief Traction Power Controller  \\nThe Chief Traction Power Controller (CTPC) shall perform the following duties: -  \\n1. Study of all failure reports of OHE, switching stations etc. daily specially In so far as they affect \\nthe operation of trains and submit connected periodical reports to AEE (TrD). He shall maintain \\ncomplete statistical data relating to operation of RC equipment and ensure that the schedules of \\nmaintenance are carried out regularly;  \\n \\n2. Scrutiny of traffic delays shown against the Traction Distribution Branch and liaison with the Chief \\nController, as necessary, for ensuring the correctness of the record s;  \\n \\n3.

Scrutinize the Log Book and the Shift DutV Register once a day and ensure that they are properly \\nmaintained and actionas necessary is taken,  \\n \\n5. In an emergency or disorganization be in direct touch with the Traffic Control Office and help in \\nevery way to restore and maintain the train services and take over operation of power control \\nhimself, if required;  \\n \\n6. Ensure that TPCs and ATPCs are adhering to the rules and instructions in force. Study all the \\nrules in force and suggest amendments, mo difications, corrections as may be found necessary in \\npractice;  \\n \\n7. Co -ordinate the Weekly Power Block Programme of all traction staff and other departments and \\nfinalize It in consultation with the Traffic Department. Take steps to adhere. to the agreed \\nprogramme as far as practicable.  \\n \\n8. Compile periodical statistics from the data collected on SCADA system and as per instruction of \\nSR.DE TrD including the analysis of failures on the SRC system, and submit thorn to Sr. DEE(TrD).  \\n \\n9. Report daily to the CEE’s office all matters as laid down by the CEE.  \\n \\n20516 Duties of Traction Power Controller  \\nHe is the official in direct charge of the control of 25 kV power supply for electric traction and shall \\nbe fully acquainted with all the traction power supply In stallations, and sectionalizing arrangements. \\nThere will be a TPC in each shift in the RCC and, depending upon the workload, he may be \\nassisted by an ATPC. The essential duties of the TPC/ATPC are as under:  \\n \\n1. When taking over shift duty, he should acqua int himself with the prevailing position of the entire \\nsection including working of the RC equipment, condition of all transformers, circuit breakers, \\nlnterruptors and isolators, sections under power block, any special Instructions to be carriedout, -\\nmovern ents of important officials connected with the traction distribution system, position of the \\nOHE Inspection Cars and break - down vehicles etc.;  \\n2. Maintain continuous contact with the Power Supply Authorities;  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUM E 11 PART 1   120  \\n 3.Maintain continuous contact with the Traffic Section Controllers in regard to power supply affecting \\ntrain movements, imposition of power blocks etc.;  \\n \\n4.In the event of power supply Interruptions or other failures, take prompt actio n in accordance with \\nprescribed rules and local instructions for restoration of supply;  \\n \\n5.Imposition of and removal of power blocks as required, following the prescribed procedure and \\nsafety rules.  \\n \\n6.In the event of power supply failures, OHE break -downs, accidents etc. in the electrified section, \\nadvise promptly the concerned Foreman, AEE, DEE/5r.

Record of standing instructions.  \\n(iii) Register of temporary instructions.  \\n(iv)  Register of Staff  Movements;  \\n (v)  Emergency Telephone Testing Register.  \\n(v) Register of train delays due to failures of signal supply.  \\n (vill) Weather forecast register.  \\n \\n9)By 10 h each day submit the following reports to Sr. DEE/ DEE (TrD) and other officials as laid \\ndown  in local instructions: -  \\n \\n(I)    List of power blocks availed.  \\n(ii) Particulars of telecommunication failures.  \\n(iii) Particulars of RC failures  \\n(iv)  Power Supply failures.  \\n(v) Maximum demand and energy consumption at each traction sub -station.  \\n(vi) Condition of traction sub -station equipment  \\n(vii) All unusual occurrences, if any.  \\n20517 Failure of Traction Power Supply  \\n \\nFailure of 25 kV ac, 50 Hz Signal phase power supply can be due to  \\n \\n(a) failure of equipment of Supply Authorities or  \\n \\n(b) failure of railway equipment.  \\n \\nWhen the  indications at the RCC are that failure of power supply is over the entire area fed by one \\nsub-station, the cause and likely duration of failure should be ascertained immediately from the \\nOperator of the Grid sub -station.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION M ANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    121  20518 Failures of Grid Supply  \\n In the event of failure of Grid power supply at a sub -station, if the Operator at the Grid sub -station \\nadvises that he anticipates that the power supply may not be restored in less than 3 min , the TPC \\nshould immediately initiate emergency working extending the feed from the adjacent substation upto \\nthe failed sub -station, as a first step. He should inform the Sr DEE /DEE (TrD), AEE (TrD) and \\nSection Controller of this situation. He should also  keep in continuous communication with the Grid \\nsub-station, persue and restore supply to OHE as quickly as possible.  \\n \\n20519 Prolonged Power Supply Failures  \\n1.   If the power supply Is anticipated to be restored after 10 minutes, as ascertained from the \\nOperator at the Grid sub -station, or if he is unable to state when power supply is likely to be \\nrestored, TPC shall immediately proceed as follows:  \\n \\n(a) Advise the Deputy/Section Controller that emergency feeding arrangements are being \\nintroduced In the a rea fed by the particular sub -station. The Section Controller shall then inform the \\nstations on either side of the concerned feeding post to issue caution orders to every electric loco \\nand EMU driver entering the affected area to lower pantographs while pa ssing the feeding post, \\nspecifying the structure number at which the Driver shall lower pantograph and the structure number \\non reaching which, he may raise it. The Section Controller shall also repeat the information to all \\nloco sheds, both major and - mino r, and to all train ordering stations. After this has been done the \\nSection Controller shall confirm to the TPC that Instructions for Issue of caution orders for lowering \\nof pantographs have been issued and emergency feeding arrangements may be made. These  \\ninstructions do not apply for locations where short neutral section assemblies have been provided \\nopposite the feeding post.  \\n \\n(The Drivers of electric and EMU locomotives shall, however, continue to observe instructions \\nregarding \"Open DJ\" and \"Close DJ\"  at the neutral sections as usual).  \\n \\n(b) On receipt of the above information, TPC will open the two 25 kV feeder circuit breakers at the \\nsub- station where supply is interrupted and put \"Red Warning Caps\"/\"Device inhibited tags\" on the \\ncorresponding contr ol switches in the RCC.  \\n(C) TPC will then close the bridging interruptors at the neutral Sections on either side.  \\n(D)On restoration of supply from the grid sub -station, \"Red Warning Caps\"/\"Device inhibited tags\" \\nshall not be removed and the feeder circui t breakers shad not be closed until the bridging \\nintenuptors have been opened first.  \\n2.   If emergency feeding is to be continued for long periods, temporary signals for lowering and \\nraising of pantographs shall be provided.  \\n \\n20520 Faults on Railway Equi pment and Lines  \\nAny faults on OHE and 25 kV feeders lines will cause the corresponding feeder circuit breaker to \\ntrip,. thus interrupting supply to the corresponding sector. When this happens TPC shall reclose it \\nonce immediately. If It trips again he sha ll keep the circuit breaker open and proceed to isolate the \\nfault. Where auto reclosing feature is provided, the TPC should take action to isolate the fault after \\nthe auto -reclosure scheme locks out. After isolation of faulty section TPC shall release the auto \\nreclosure lock -out.  \\n \\n20521 Lowering Pantographs of Defective Locos  \\nBefore concluding that the fault is on the the OHE and directing the OHE staff to proceed to the \\nfaulty section to rectify the fault, the TPC should first make sure that there is no defective locomotive \\nor EMU in the faulty section, which could cause tripping of the feeder circuit breaker. If there is a \\nlocomotive in the faulty section he should arrange to have its pantograph lowered to ascertain if the \\nfault is on the OHE or on the l ocomotive.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     122 Drivers and rnotormen should lower the pantographs of their units if they have reason to believe that \\na fault has developed causing tripping of 25 kV feeder circuit breaker at the s ub-station as for \\nexample when 25 kV supply gets interrupted simultaneously with the tripping of the air blast circuit \\nbreaker on the rolling -stock. If this happens more than once, It is most probable that the 25 kV \\npower supply interruption is due to faul t on the loco. In such a case, the Driver should lower the \\npantograph and inform the TPC through emergency or other telephone of his observations and \\naction taken by him so that TPC may take appropriate action. Whenever pantograph on. the loco is \\ndefective , the TPC should ensure from the driver that the pantograph is properly tied down and \\nsecured, and does not come into contact with the OHE.  \\n \\n20522 Isolation of Faulty Section  \\n \\n1.   Expeditious isolation of a faulty section Is of the greatest importance. This can only be achieved \\nif the TPCs are fully drilled in the correct method of fault localization. The method of fault localization \\nwhich takes the least possible average time Is the best. It Is best to standardize the procedure with \\na \"Control Card\" for  every circuit breaker and keep the card in a serial order so that, when a circuit \\nbreaker trips, the particular card can be picked out and the sequence of switching operations, as \\ngiven in the card, carried out in the card till the faulty section is. isol ated and power restored to the \\nother sections. Such control cards ensure correct sequence of operations Irrespective of who is the \\nTPC on shift duty.  \\n \\n2,    Fig 5.01 is a typical control card for a double line section. The basic idea is to divide the sect ion \\ninto sub - sections and find out whether the circuit breaker trips or not after reclosure. The full -line \\narrow shows the action to be taken if the circuit breaker holds and the dotted line arrow, if it does \\nnot. Following the arrows action has to be tak en to open or close the interruptors and the feeder \\ncircuit breaker till the faulty section is identified.  \\n \\n3.   Sr. DEE (TrD) should ensure that control cards similar to the above are carefully prepared and \\nkept with TPC for every feeder circuit breaker.  He should also ensure that all TPCs and ATPCs are \\nfully familiar with the method of using the control cards. In the case of some SCADA systems, the \\nfault localization and isolation sequence is automatic. TPC should carefully note the sequence and \\nthe sect ion that is isolated. He should ensure that power supply is available on the rest of the OHE \\nafter a fault -tripping is noticed and try to minimize the length of the faulty section by directly opening \\nof isolators manually.  \\n \\n4.   While control card is gene rally drawn up after careful thought, yet, there could be reduction in \\naverage time taken to localise a fault by a change in the switching operations. This may be brought \\nout by any official to the notice of Sr. DEE/TrD.  \\n \\n20523 Faulty Section to be kept I solated  \\n(A) On Single Line Sections  \\n \\nAfter the fault has been located, the faulty section shall be kept isolated by keeping open the \\nconcerned isolators. Feed to other elementary sections shall be restored by closing the concerned \\ninterruptors/isolators.   \\n \\n(B) On other than Single Line Sections  \\n \\nAfter the faulty section has been located in accordance with para 20522, the faulty section as also \\nthe healthy sections on the adjacent lines over the.same route as the faulty section, shall be kept \\nisolated by keeping open the concerned interruptors. Feed to all other sections shall be restored by \\nclosing of other interruptors/isolators.  \\n \\nFurther, the Section Controller shall be immediately informed by the TPC of the faulty and healthy \\nsections. Feed to the hea lthy sections isolated shall be restored only on receipt of advice from the \\nSection Controller of his having taken special precautions as per para, 20524.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    123   \\n20524 Advice to Section Controller  \\n(A) Faulty Section  \\nThe Section Controller shall Immediately be informed by the TPC to take all precautions as per Station \\nWorking Rules, as though the particular faulty section is under emergency power block and the Assistant \\nTraction Foreman or other tra ction official in the neighbourhood shall be advised to cheek the faulty section. \\nAEE ffrd) and DEE (TrD) shall also be informed.  \\n \\nOnly when the OHE staff are able to Inspect and find out the nature of the fault, it will be possible for them to \\nsay how lo ng It will take to rectify the fault and restore the power supply. The Section Controller shall decide \\nwhether single line working Is to be Introduced or not taking into account the following factors :  \\n \\n(a) The traffic he has on hand,  \\n \\n(b)The  anticipated  time by  which the OHE maintenance staff can reach the site as ascertained from TPC.  \\n \\n(B) Healthy section kept isolated (Para 20523)  \\n \\nOn receipt of advise frorn TPC of temporary isolation of healthy section on line adjacent to a faulty section, the \\nSecti on Controller shall irnrnediately take necessary action for having caution orders issued to drivers of all \\ntrains due to enter any of the concerned block sections (wdth OHE temporarily isolated, though healthy) to \\nwatch out for possible obstruction arising  due to an unusual occurrence on a track with faulty OHE and be \\nprepared to stop.  \\n \\nIn respect of the trains stranded in any of such concerned block sections, it will be possible to issue caution \\norders to their drivers only after they reach the next stati on. Separate Instructions for drivers of such trains to \\nproceed cautiously upto next station, In case of being detained in block section for no tension in OHE for more \\nthan 5 rnin, are contained in G & SR etc.  \\n \\n20525 Information to Traction Staff  \\nAll inf ormation regarding any unusual occurrence received from Station Masters etc. shal l be given by the \\nSection Controller to the TPC to assist him to quickly locate faults.  \\n \\n20526 Action to Rectify OHE Fault  \\n \\n1.   The Section Controller shall give top priori ty for the movement of the maintenance staff (by train, OHE \\ninsection Car or motor trolley) to reach the faulty section, it is the duty of all concerned to reach the break -\\ndown site either by rail or by road in the quickest possible time. They should carry   with them a portable \\nemergency telephone and keep in touch with TPC.  \\n \\n2.   The TPC after locating the   fault shall reduce the section under power block to the elementary section \\nconcerned by arranging either by trained station staff or TrD staff the op ening of isolator Switches. They shall, \\nafter Inspecting the fault, inform TPC the tirne expected to be taken for rectifying the same. TPC shall pass on \\nthis Information to the Section Controller.  \\n \\n3.   The OHE staff shall then take a permit -to-work and p roceed to rectify the fault duly observing the rules for \\nthe purpose.  \\n20527 Emergency Telephone Working  \\nIf an Operator at a Grid sub -station Is not able to speak to the adjacent Grid sub -station due to some fault or \\nfailure on their telecommunication sys tem, the TPC shall arrange for the, messages to be transmitted ovp -r \\nthe railway or other telephone, where practicable. Similarly, in case of fault or failure. of telecommunication \\nsystem on the railway, the Operator of the Grid sub -station shall arrange t o transmit messages, if any from the \\nTPC to any other  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAI -. VOLUME 11 PART 1      125  sub-station through the Grid telecommunication system, on a reciprocal basis. Such messages \\nshould be passed only if they are very ur gent and related to maintaining continuity or restoration of \\npower supply.  \\n20528 Breakdowns and Emergencies  \\n \\nThe TPC shall always be in a state of readiness to take quick and prompt action to tackle any \\nbreakdown or emergencies. He will keep liaison with  not only the field officials at site who are \\nengaged in restoration of affected section, but also the Head Quarter officials, giving details of the \\nbreakdown to the extent, they are known apart from, help from the neighbouring divisions or Head \\nQuarters a s the circumstances warrant.  \\n \\n20529 Obstruction of Track - Protective Steps to be taken by TPC  \\n \\nOn being informed by the Section Controller/Station Master of any accident/incident likely to \\nobstruct one or more tracks or OHE in a multitrack section, nece ssitating immediate suspension of \\nmovement of trains and being told by Section Controller to switch off power, the TPC shall \\nimmediately switch off power supply to the OHE of the affected track as also that of the adjacent \\ntracks over the length of the tra  ek affected. The power supply shall be restored only after it is \\nconfirmed to the TPC that the track and OHE are clear of any obstruction and movement of electric \\ntrains is safe.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MA NUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [126]   \\n  \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER VI  \\nPOWER BLOCKS AND PERMITS -TO-WORK  \\n20600 Operation of Isolator Switches  \\n \\n1.   Before considering the procedure for obtaining power blocks, attention is  drawn to the \\nprecautions to be taken in opening an isolator switch ...Manually operated isolator switches are \\nprovided at different points on the main line to sectionalize the OHE into elementary sections and at \\nlarge yards to isolate different elementary sections for maintenance of the OHE.  \\n \\n2.   The operating handle of  every isolator switch shall always be kept locked either in the open or \\nclosed position. Any loss or damage of a padlock or key shall be reported immediately to the OHE \\nSection Chargeman, Chief Traction Foreman (OHE) and TPC.  \\n \\n3.    An isolator switch is  not meant for breaking a current, but only to break a circuit when no \\ncurrent is passing through it. If an attempt is made to open a switch when it is actually carrying \\ncurrent, severe arcing will occur at the switch contacts and may result in serious con sequences \\nincluding danger to the operator. AN ISOLATOR SWITCH SHALL NOT BE OPENED WHEN \\nCURRENT IS PASSING THROUGH IT.  \\n4.   Isolator switches on the main line may only be opened provided the corresponding sub -sector is \\nfirst made dead by TPC. The person o perating the isolator switch shall not open It, unless \\nspecifically asked to do so by TPC by a clear message supported by a private number or after \\nreceipt of a separate permit -to-work for the section which includes the elementary sections on either \\nthe is olator switch. TPC shall ensure that the sub -sector is dead before he orders opening of an \\nIsolator switch in it.  \\n \\n5.    Isolator switches, however, can be closed by a duly authorised person even if the adjacent \\nlnterruptors are  closed (i.e. on load) prov ided the closure is made swiftly In one motion. It is  \\nimperative that once the fixed  and moving contacts have met, the contacts are not separated.                                               \\n \\n20601 Isolators in Yards and Sheds  \\n \\n(a) Isolator switches pr ovided for isolating sidings and yards and also to feed OHE inside running \\nsheds, may be opened provided the official concerned makes it certain that -  \\n \\n(a) the entire section is visible; and  \\n \\n(b) There is no locomotive with raised pantograph in the sect ion.  \\n \\nIf is not possible to get an assurance of these conditions, the principles of para 20600 -4 shall be \\nfollowed.  \\n \\n20602 Maintenance Blocks  \\nThere are generally two types of blocks required for maintenance work on electric traction \\nInstallations:  \\n \\n(a) Traffic Block:  Where a line is blocked against movement of vehicles whether steam, electric or \\ndiesel locomotive hauled. This will be required whenever heavy repair have to be carried out. A \\ntraffic block will be granted by the Section Controller in consu ltation with the TPC.  \\n \\n(b) Power Block: Where a section of line is blocked against movement of electric locomotive hauled \\nvehicles or EMUs only i.e., a section where 25 kV electric supply to the OHE is switched off and the \\nsection made dead. Power block w ill  be required whenever light repairs to or maintenance of the \\nOHE  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1                                      128  has to be carried out and the nature of the work is such that traffic block is not neces sary. Power \\nblocks are granted by TPC in consultation with the Section Controller. Whenever a power block is \\ngranted by TPC, movement of vehicles hauled by other than electric power, i.e., steam or diesel \\nmay be permitted, provided a caution order is issue d as per General and Subsidiary Rules drawing \\nthe attention of the Driver to the fact that the OHE staff are working at the kilometerage specified \\nand he should exercise caution when passing over the section and obey signals displayed at the \\nplace of work.                                                                              \\n \\n20603 Power Blocks  \\n1. Power blocks are of three different types:  \\n(a) Emergency power block,  \\n(b) Pre -arranged power block,  \\n(c) Locally arranged power block.  \\n \\nPower blocks on the OHE of \"Secondary lines\", i.e. -, siding, yards, sheds, etc. arranged by the \\nStation Master, Yard Master, Shed Foreman or Engine Examiner concerned locally come under \\ncategory (c).  \\n \\n2.   In all cases of power block TPC shall put red warning caps on con trol switches corresponding to \\ninterruptors which are kept open for isolating the section. Similarly, warning boards shall be fixed on \\nall manually operated switches opened locally for isolating the section. This shall be done by the \\noperator who opens the  switches. These red warning caps and warning boards can be removed \\nonly when cancelling the power block. In case SCADA system is in operation instructions issued for \\nthe operation of the system shall be followed.  \\n \\n20604 Emergency Power Block  \\nAn \"Emergen cy PowerBlock\" shall be arranged by the TPC and25 kv supply to the OHE affected \\nshall be switched off by him immediately on receipt of an advice of any break -down of the OHE or \\nInjury to persons or damage to property particularly in the following cases:  \\n \\n(a) The whole or part of the OHE or a feeder or a cable falling down and or persons or animals or \\nfalling trees or vehicles coming in contact with or likely to come in contact with live equipment;  \\n \\n(b) A damaged catenary or contact wire fouling the vehicl e gauge;  \\n \\n(c) A damaged electric locomotive getting damaged to rectify which the Driver requires the permit -\\nto-work;  \\n \\n(d) Derailment or any other traffic accident on the electrified lines, where cutting off of 25 kV power \\nsupply is considered necessary b y TPC or the Section Controller, in the Interest of safety. ,  \\n \\n20605 Reporting Abnormalities in OHE  \\n \\nIt is the duty of every railway official to report immediately any abnormalities on the OHE such as \\nare mentioned  \\nin para 20604 or of tracks, masts/ str uctures or pantographs of locomotives As may adversely affect \\nsafety of trains                    movements, to the TPC either directly or through any Station Master, \\nSection Controller or through the nearest available telephone. If the damage is heavy or the moving \\ndimensions are infringed he should take steps to protect the lines in accordance with General and \\nSubsidiary Rules.  \\n20606 Request for Emergency Power Block  \\n1. The person who gives the first Information of break -down on the OHE shall invariably give all \\nessential information. such as his name, designation, kilometerage where the abnormality has been \\nnoticed, its nature and  \\nINDIAN  RAOOVAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME]] PART 1     129  place from where he is reporting. He should leave the place on ly with the permission of the TPC.  \\n \\n2.   The reason for asking for an emergency power block should be brief and to the point, but \\nexplicit. Much time and trouble can be saved if the first information given is clear and unambiguous, \\nto enable the TPC to de cide upon the course of action to be taken.  \\n \\n20607 Action to be taken TPC  \\n \\nOn receiving the information the TPC shall immediately arrange to switch off power supply to the \\nsection affected (the details of defects being obtained after the supply is switch ed off). He shall at \\nthe same time advise the Section Controller on duty the section made dead by him. The Section \\nController in turn should arrange with the Station Masters concerned to take protective measures in \\naccordance with \"Station Working Rules\".  \\n \\n20608 Precautions after Emergency Power Block is Imposed  \\nOnce an emergency power block is imposed, no work on the affected lines shall be commenced \\nuntil an authorized OHE official arrives at site and earths the OHE. at two points or more as per \\nrules. Power supply to the section concerned shall not be restored by TPC until the authorized \\nofficial at the site issue a message supported by private number.  \\n \\n20609 Identification of Sectors, Sub -Sectors and Elementary Sections  \\n \\n1.   It is vitally important for every Railway official who has occasion to ask for Power block to know \\nthe correct method of Identifying and describing any section of the OHE where shutdown is \\nrequired. He should have with him the upto -date Station Working Rule Diagram for the sectio n, \\nshowing all relevant particulars such as station names, position of all isolators, interruptors, circuit \\nbreakers, \"up\" and \"down\" tracks, cross -over section insulators, sectors, sub -sectors and \\nelementary section numbers.  \\nSectors: These are described by referring to a section of OHE of a track which can be energized by \\nclosing a feeder circuit breaker at the substation/ feeding post. It covers the section between sub -\\nstation/feeding post and adjacent neutral sections.  \\n \\nSub-sectors: These are described  by the names of two limiting switching stations in the order in \\nwhich the train moves and adding the name of the track, e.g., Sub -sector Kendposi -Tabu Dn.  \\n \\nElementary Sections: are referred to by four/five digit numbers. The sections are numbered seriall y \\nin the direction of power supply i.e., from the feeding post/substation towards the neutral section or \\nthe terminal point. At each feeding post/sub -station a new series of numbers starts. The first \\ntwo/three digits represent the interrupter controlling f eed to the section and the last two digits the \\nserial number of the elementary section. Up line elementary sections have progressively odd \\nnumbers and Down line elementary sections have progressively even numbers. e.g., elementary \\nsection 0202 means the fi rst elementary section from the feeding post/sub -station on the down line, \\nfed by interrupter 02.  \\n \\nWhenever there is a doubt in the description, the person asking for power block shall state clearly \\nthe track and OHE structure numbers between which work i s to be done.  \\n \\n20610 Telephone Messages  \\nAll messages relating to shut -down and restoration of power supply, permits -to-work, etc. issued \\nover the telephone shall invariably be supported by exchange of Private Numbers. The procedure to \\nbe followed is as d etailed below -  \\n \\n(a) Every official who has to exchange such messages shall maintain a Private Number book. As \\neach message is sent, the Private Number used should be scored out in the Private Number sheet, \\ninitialled and dated. The message number should also be recorded. Every Private Number book and \\npermit -to-  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1     130  work form is an important document and should be carefully preserved for a period of one year \\nunless required for a longer period i n connection with an inquiry or investigation.  \\n \\n \\n(b) Every message shall start with the Private Number of the sender and end with the Private \\nNumber of the person who has received it.  \\n \\n(c) Messages should be brief and to the point. They shall be written out in full before they are sent. \\nThe description of the section on which power block is required should be unambiguous as detailed \\nin para 20609. All messages regarding permits -to-work shall be in the standard form.  \\n \\n(d) The same person who asks for and obtains a power block should also cancel it before power \\nsupply is restored. The persons exchanging the private numbers should identify themselves by \\nname over the telephone.  \\n \\n(e) The correctness of every massage shall be confirmed by the person who has r eceived it by \\nrepeating it. Each message shall be recorded by the sender as well as by the receiver in message \\nbooks maintained for the purpose.  \\n \\n(f)To avoid confusion, use words \"Open\" and. \"Close\" shall be used instead of phonetically similar \\nwords such  as \"Switch Off\", \"Switch On\". Whenever necessary words may have to be spelt out \\n(e.g.,1 (one) 4 (four) and not fourteen), B for Bombay, C for Calcutta and so on.  1   \\n20611 Procedure for Obtaining Traffic or Power Blocks and Permits -to-work  \\n \\nOfficials in  the electrified area who require prearranged traffic blocks, power blocks or permits -to-\\nwork in the danger zone of traction equipment, or who require OHE and or bonding staff to be \\npresent at site for scheduled maintenance works, shall deliver at the offi ce of Sr DEE (TrD) not later \\nthan 10 hours on the first working day of the week statements in the prescribed form showing -  \\n(I)  the nature of the work and the date on which it is to be performed;  \\n(ii) by whom the work is to be carried out  \\n(iii)location of the work and the section of the lines to be blocked;  \\n(iv)The trains between which the block is required; and  \\n(v)Whether the track will be available for steam or diesel traffic.  \\n \\n2.   The requirements of all departments will be co -ordinated in the off ice of Sr. DEE (TRD) and a \\nconsolidated statement forwarded to the Senior Divisional Operating Manager concerned, by 12 \\nhours on every Wednesday, for inclusion in the weekly programme of traffic and power blocks.  \\n \\n3. Works of an urgent nature shall be att ended to by obtaining emergency blocks and permits -to-\\nwork from TPC  \\n \\n4.   A weekly programme of work involving traffic blocks, power blocks and permits -to-work shall be \\nprepared in the office of Sr. DOM and dispatched to all concerned (TPC, TLC, Loco Sheds , Station \\nMasters/Yard Masters concerned and Traffic Controller in addition to the departmental officials who \\nasked for the blocks).  \\n \\n5.   All the traction sub -stations have two states of traction power transformers and associated \\nswitch gear. Maintenance  of equipment of the traction sub -station, therefore, does not necessitate \\ntotal shut down of 25 kV supply at each sub -station. Whenever any maintenance or breakdown is to \\nbe attended In the traction sub -station, the permit to work should be obtained by th e Supervisor \\nincharge from the TPC and after completing the work, the permit to work should be returned by the \\nSupervisor incharge to the TPC. Similiarly at the switching stations  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1                                        131  normally the alternative feed is available to the concerned sub -sector and therefore, does not \\nnecessitate the power block but only a permit to work should be obtained from the TPC and after \\ncompletion of the work, the same should b e rerturned to the TPC. In case of attending to the gantry \\nof a switching station, complete block of the switching station is required for which power block has \\nto be taken from the TPC.  \\n20612 Pre -arranged Power Block  \\nAfter a prearranged power block has been agreed to be granted and an advice to this effect \\ncirculated to all the concerned, the following gives the detailed procedure to be adopted by the \\nSection Controller and the TPC for granting the power block. Assume that power block is required \\non the Up line between station             ..........  and .............. on Elementary Section No . ......... at 1 \\n0-00 hours after the passage of a specified Up train (say \\'X\\'): -  \\n \\n1. On the scheduled day about two hours before the block period, i.e., at about  8.00 hours, TPC will \\nobtain confirmation from the Section Controller concerned that the trains are running to time and \\npower block will be available as, scheduled, after the Train No. \\'X\\' Up has passed station at about 1 \\n0-00 hrs.  \\n \\n2.The TPC will pass on  information to the Chargeman of the maintenance gang that the power \\nblock, as already arranged, will he available in time.  \\n \\n3.The maintenance gang should arrange to leave the depot in time with all materials and tools so as \\nto be ready at site at about 9 . 30 hrs. The OHE staff (in charge of the work) on arrival at site should \\nimmediately contact the TPC and inform him of their arrival.  \\n \\nAny person detailed to open an isolator switch for switching off power supply shall also report to \\nTPC of his arrival a t site at the required location.  \\n \\nThe maintenance gang should carry at least two portable telephone sets and the necessary earthing \\npole assembly along with them while proceeding to do maintenance work on the OHE.  \\n \\n4. The TPC should maintain continuous c ontact with the OHE staff at site.  \\n5. As soon \\'X\\' Up clears the Up track between . ....... and .............. Section Controller should inform \\nStation Master on duty at all stations concerned to arrange for \"longitudinal\" and \"cross\" protection \\nas laid do wn in Station Working Rules (see paras 20621 to 20626).  \\n \\n6. The Station Master shall ensure that the protection as specified In the Station Working Rules is \\ncarried out and confirm it to the Section Controller with exchange of Private Numbers.  \\n \\n7. The Se ction Controller on receipt of assurances from the concerned Station Masters will advise \\nTPC that the power block may be given.                                           \\n \\n8. If the power block message is given by TPC In the prescribed printed form the Sect ion Controller \\nwill sign the same and send it to the TPC; if it is given over the telephone, the Section Controller will \\ngrant the power block through a message with exchange of Private Numbers.  \\n \\n9. On receipt of the above message TPC will open the interr uptors concerned and issue messages \\nto the field staff for operation of the required isolators. On receipt of the confirmatory message that \\nthe isolators have been opened, TPC will close the interruptors restoring power supply to all parts, \\nexcept over the  particular elementary section where work has to be done. He WILL then issue a \\npermit -to-work message in the prescribed form to the authorized person in charge of the \\nmaintenance gang.  \\n10.After obtaining permit to work, the authorized person may use a fla g signal (Yellow flag) to direct \\nthe nominated staff to discharge and earth the OHE at two or more points.  \\n11.The maintenance gang will start the work after taking necessary safety precautions to protect \\nthemselves,  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    132 viz., by earthing , display of banner flags etc. as detailed in General and Subsidiary Rules. ,9  \\n \\nNote: On sections with automatic signalling, the signals may be at danger due to earthing of OHE \\nwith the rails during the period of the power block. The Station Master shall issue necessary \\nauthority as per rules for steam, and diesel trains when these are permitted to be moved over the \\nsection under power block.  \\n \\n20613 Restoration Of  Supply After a Permit -to-work is Returned  \\nOn com pletion of the work, the person who received the permit -to-work shall ensure that -  \\n \\n(a) all men and materials have been withdrawn from the electrical equipment and its vicinity,  \\n(b) all earths provided for the protection of the working parties have been  removed; and  \\n(c) all staff, who have been deputed to work, are warned that the power supply is to be restored.  \\n \\nHe should then inform TPC by a message, supported by Private Number, that the work, for which \\nthe permit - to-work was issued, has been comple ted, the men and materials have been withdrawn \\nfrom the specified section, the earths have been removed and power supply may be restored to the \\nsection. This shall constitute cancellation of the permit -to-work previously obtained.  \\n \\n20614 Work by other tha n Authorized Persons  \\n \\n1.If work is to be carried out on or adjacent to any, part of the electrical equipment by other than \\n\\'authorized\\' persons such work shall not commence until the person in -charge of the work is  in \\npossession of a written permit -to-work in the prescribed form issued to him by an \\'authorized\\' \\nperson.  \\n \\n Such permits -to-work in the prescribed form shall only be issued an\\' authorized\\' person of the \\nElectric Traction Branch not below the rank of a Senior Linesman.  \\n \\n2. The permit -to-work sh all first be taken from TPC by an \\'authorized\\' person who shall earth the \\nelectrical equipment specified and hand over a permit -to-work card to the person in -charge of the \\nwork getting an acknowledgment on the other copy. A duplicate copy of every permit -to-work card \\nshall be retained in the personal possession of the \\'authorized\\' person who issued it.  \\n \\n3. On completion of the work and when all men and materials have been withdrawn from the electric \\nequipment and its vicinity, the person in -charge of the w orking party shall cancel his permit -to-work \\ncard and return it to the \\'authorized\\' person who issued it. The \\'authorized\\' person shall in turn issue \\na message to TPC to cancel permit -to-work as detailed in para 20613.  \\n \\n20615 Local Cancellation of Permit -to-Work When Telephones are Interrupted  \\n \\nIf telephone communication with TPC is interrupted when a permit to work is to be cancelled, the \\nauthorized person to whom the permit -to-work was issued shall arrange locally for restoring the \\nnormal (live) conditi ons on the equipment specified in the permit -to-work and for cancelling the \\npower block, if possible. Before this is done the authorized person should satisfy himself that no \\nother party has been given a permit -to-work for the same section.  \\n \\n20616 Multipl e Working Parties  \\n \\n1. Whenever work has to be carried out by more than one working party, within a sub -sector or an \\nelementary -to-work shall be issued by the TPC only to one authorized person who alone shall be \\nresponsible,   section, the permit to work . O ther party or parties may work for all work on the portion \\nof electrical equipment specified in the permit -to-work. Other party or parties on the same portion of \\nelectrical equipment only with the permission of this authorized person. The authorized person  shall \\ncancel the permit -to-work only when he has satisfied himself that all working parties who have been  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     133 permitted by him to work in the section covered by the permit -to-work have withdrawn t heir men and \\nmaterials and have removed the earths from the electrical equipment on which they had worked. In \\nthe event of telephone communication being interrupted, the person responsible shall take action as \\nprovided in para 20615 above for cancellation of the power block.    \\n2. Where the two parties are working far from each other, the party who has to work for a longer \\nperiod shall take the permit -to-work and then permit the other party to start his work by a message \\nsupported by a Private Number. The s econd party shall inform the party from whom he got the \\npermit -to-work of completion of work and removal of earths and withdrawal of men and material by a \\nmessage supported by Private Number.  \\n \\n20617 Entries in the Log Book  \\n \\nThe number of each permit -to-work issued must be entered in the log book by TPC together with \\nthe particulars and time when the equipment is made dead and re -energized after completion for the \\nwork, as per information received on telephone from the \\'authorized\\' person concerned.  \\n \\n2061 8 Work Inside Loco Shed or Car Shed  \\n \\nFor work to be done Inside the loco sheds or car sheds, the application for permit -to-work must he \\nmade to the Traction Foreman, Assistant Traction Foreman or Chargernan (RS) who shall arrange \\nfor the issue of the perm it- to-work after getting the switch of the inspection bay or the feeders \\nopened. No intimation to TPC is necessary. The permit -to-work must be received for cancellation \\nfrom the person in -charge of the work by the Traction Foreman, Assistant Traction Fore man or \\nChargeman (RS) before the switches are closed.  \\n \\n20619 Local Block  \\n \\nPower supply for sidings which do not affect movements of trains on the main lines, for loop lines \\nand reception and despatch yards, is controlled by manually operated isolators. K eys for these \\nisolators are usually in the custody of the Stationmaster concerned. Power blocks on such sidings \\ncan be arranged when required by an authorized official subject to the following:  \\n \\n(1) The Station Master, Cabin Assistant Station Master, and others responsible for the movement of \\ntraffic, should take measures detailed in para 20621, 20622 and 20625.  \\n \\n(ii) TPC shall be informed. before and after the shut -down is effected.  \\n \\niii) isolators may only be opened after due precautions prescribed in para 20600, 20622 and 20625.  \\n \\n(iv) Earthing of equipment and issue of permit -to-work is done as prescribed in these rules.  \\n \\nLocal power blocks shall be recorded in form ETR -4 prescribed for the purpose.  \\n \\n20620 Protective Measures for Power Blocks  \\n \\nIt Is essential that every Railway official concerned with the movement of trains on the electrified \\nsection, have a thorough understanding of the precautions to be taken to ensure safety of staff \\nworking on the OHE under power blocks. The reasons for the prec autions and the nature of the \\nprecautions are therefore given at some length in the following para graphs.  1 9   \\nThe protective measures are -  \\n \\n(a) Longitudinal Protection: To stop movement of electric rolling -stock running on the same track on \\nwhich a s ection has been made dead and power block has been granted.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [134]   \\n \\n 20622 Transverse or Cross Protection  \\n1.   Section insulators have been provided on crossovers to sepa rate and insulate different sections \\nof OHE from each other, e.g., the up track from the Down track, the main line from the siding yard, \\nOHE inside a loco maintenance shed from the yard lines.  1   \\n2.   A section insulator, comprises of a strain insulator,  with two runners connected to one of contact \\nwires as shown in Fig. 3.02 (Chapter 111). The runners are at the same height as the contact with \\nthe other side, and also shaped so as to allow a smooth passage of the pantograph underneath. It \\nwill be seen fr om Fig. 3.02 that the two runners overlap with the contact wire on the other side for a \\nshort distance to ensure that there Is no Interruption of the current drawn by the locomotive as it \\npasses under the section insulator.  \\n \\n3. Electric rolling -stock with  raised pantograph should, therefore, never be allowed to pass below a \\nsection insulator if a power block has been given on one of the tracks, as the pantograph will \\nmomentarily connect the live OIAE with the dead OHE, while bridging the runners and contac t wire. \\nThis again energizes the dead section and endangers lives of those who are working on it.  \\n \\n4.   In view of its extreme importance the rule is again repeated: Under no circumstances should \\nelectric rolling - stock be passed below an insulated overla p span or a section insulator which \\nseparates a dead section on which a power block has been granted, from the line section.  \\n \\n20623 Procedure for Arranging Longitudinal and Transverse Protection  \\n1.   Before a power block is granted the Section Controller  should advise the Station Master,o Yard \\nMasters and Cabin Assistant Station Masters concerned to protect the dead sections, both \\nlongitudinally and transversely. It is only when all the Station Masters and Cabin Assistant Station \\nMasters concerned have co nfirmed that this has been done, the Section Controller can advise TPC \\nagreeing to the grant of power block. The Station Master, Yard Master and Cabin Assistant Station \\nMaster concerned will continue to maintain protection till the power block is cancelled  by the Section \\nController.  \\n \\n2.   The Section Controller will in turn permit removal of protection only after the power block is \\ncancelled by TPC.  \\n \\n20624 Station Working Rules for Longitudinal and Transverse Protection 1  \\n1. In view of the large number o f possible movements which may accidentally energize a dead \\nsection under a power block, the various protective measures to be taken by each Station Master, \\nCabin Assistant Station Master and Yard Master when power block is granted for the various \\nsectors,  sub-sectors or elementary sections should be catalogued in the Station Working Rules for \\neach station. It is the duty of every Station Master, Yard Master and Assistant Yard Master to be \\nthoroughly familiar with these instructions so as to be able to carr y out efficiently and quickly the \\nprotective measures prescribed.  \\n \\n2. The Station Working Rules should contain -  \\n \\n(a) rules to be generally observed by  all stations;  \\n \\n(b) a chart giving exactly what precautions have to be taken for granting power. blocks  on each \\nsector, sub -sector or elementary section; and  \\n \\n(c) a drawing showing the wired and unwired tracks as well as the sectionalizing arrangements \\nincluding. the position of signals and points referred to in the chart mentioned above.  \\n \\nThis drawing is  the only valid document to be referred to for the purpose of granting power block. No \\nmodification of the installation shall be done without its first being incorporated in the above drawing.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME 11 PART    [136]  3. In ca se of large stations, a copy of Station Working Rules may be issued to each cabin.  \\n \\n4.   Every Station Master/Yard Master/Asstt. Station master shall be Trained for the purpose and be \\nfully conversant with all the local switches/isolators/cross -overs and special Instructions applicable \\nto the equipment provided the station and as laid down in the Station Working Rules to enable him \\nto operate Isolators under instructions from TPC  \\n \\n20625 Protection of Dead Section  \\nThe protection of a dead section i s achieved by the following means:  \\n \\n(a) In the normal running direction, movements of trains are generally controlled by signals. \\nProtection is obtained by placing a \"Red Warning Collar\" on the signal lever controlling the \\nconcerned signals, painted with inscription \"Beware - No Voltage\".  \\n \\n(b) If the points and signals are locally operated, they should be locked and the keys controlling the \\nlever or lever frames should be kept with the Station Master on duty. When the signal cabin or lever \\nframes are cont rolled electrically by a Station Master or a Cabin Assistant Station Master, the \\nStation Master or Cabin Assistant on duty shall place the warning collars on the relevant slides of \\nelectric slide Instruments or on the relevant keys of electric transmitters  or Interlocked key boxes.  \\n \\nThis action must be taken by the Cabin Assistant may be, in respect of each and every movement \\ncompletion, confirmation should be given to the power block to be issued by the TPC.  \\n \\nStation Master or the Station Master, as the case prescribed in the Station Working Rules and after \\nSection Controller to enable him to agree for the  \\n \\nIn a large yard several warning collars may be required. Sufficient number of warning collars should \\nbe kept in each station/cabin. The exact number provided should be indicated in the corresponding \\nStation Working Rules.  \\n \\n(C) Once a warning collar is placed on the signal lever, it shad not be removed except after \\nexchange of messages with private member.  \\n \\n20626 Shunting Movement Towards Dead Section   \\n \\n1.   In cases where no signal exists for controlling the entry of an electric Train Into the dead section, \\nthe Station Master should arrange a hand stop signal to be exhibited at the point upto which alone \\nthe electric locomotive is allowed to proceed.  \\n \\nIf It is necessary for an electric locomotive to carry on shunting movement towards the dead section, \\nthe red warning collar placed on a lever may be removed to permit the movement, provided that a \\nhand stop signal as above is exhibited and the Driver Is  specifically instructed not to move the loco \\nbeyond the point.  \\n2.   An example of this operation is given In Fig. 6.02. As per para 20625 the lever controlling the \\nsignals should have \"red warning collars\" placed on them to give protection to the dead se ction. \\nHowever, If It Is essential to carry out a shunting operation with an electric locomotive situated at \\npoint \\'A\\' on the loop line to move lnto the main through the turn -out, this may be permitted provided \\nthat the shunting movement is carried out onl y upto limiting mast \\'P\\', short of the overlap span, \\nwhere a hand signal is to be exhibited to prevent all movements beyond the point \\'P\\'.  \\n3.   Train or shunting movements by other than electric locomotives, I.e., by steam or diesel locos, \\nmay be permitte d to enter the dead section, provided that the Station Master ensures by personal \\ninspection that the Train formation does not include an electric locomotives or OHE Inspection Car \\nor EMU with pantograph raised. The 11 red warning collars\" may be permitted  to be removed to \\nallow such movements.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [137]   \\n20628 Standard Forms for Power Block Messages  \\n \\nTypical forms for power block messages are attached at the end of this Chapter.  \\n \\nForm ETR. 1 This h as 3 parts and is used for exchange of message between TPC and Section \\ncontroller when a power block is to be imposed or withdrawn.

Signals and associated equipments  \\n11. Telecommunication facilities for ac traction  \\n111. Power supply for S&T installations  \\n IV.    Permanent way installations  \\n \\nVarious aspects for the general information of electrical staff are covered in this chapter. The rules \\nare covered in the Indian Railways Telecom Manual for the S&T staff and in the Indi an Railway \\nPermanent Way Manual for the civil engineering staff.  \\n \\nThe safety rules applicable to the staff of S&T and civil engineering departments are given in \\nChapter IV, Vol. 1 of this Manual.  \\n \\n1. SIGNALS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT  \\n20701 Effects of 25 k V Traction on S&T Equipment  \\n \\nAny circuit in the vicinity of OHE for 25 kV ac 50 Hz signal phase traction system is influenced by \\nelectrostatic and electromagnetic induction. The electrostatic induction is practically eliminated by \\ntransferring S&T circuit s into underground cables protected with metal sheath. The electromagnetic \\ninduction causes currents and voltages to develop in metallic items parallel to the track. The items \\ninclude the rails, traction return conductor where provided, cable sheath and S& T circuits. The \\nvoltages that occur in the metallic items appear as potential gradients. The value of induced voltage \\ndepends on various factors such as:  \\na) length of parallelism between the cable and electrified track  \\nb)  soil conductivity  \\nc) Screening effici ency of cable sheath where existing  \\nd) return current through the rails and return conductor where provided.  \\ne) mutual inductance between catenary and cable conductors  \\nf)  current carried by the OHE.  \\nAppropriate precautions to overcome the effects of the induced voltage , therfore, have to be taken \\nby S & T department.  \\n \\nOther aspects where S&T equipment is affected are:  \\ni)   OHE masts and fittings may come in the way of visibility of signals to some extent and may come \\nin the way of signal.  \\nii) Restrictions  in the path of traction currents on section provided with track circuits.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [148]  20702 Types of Signals  \\nIn the double line electrified sections, the signalling system shall generally be the colour l ight signal (CLS) \\ntype. But the semaphore signals may be maintained on single line sections (Main or branch) which are taken \\nup for Railways Electrification.  \\n \\n20703 Locations of Signals  \\n1.   Signals are so located as to afford maximum visibility to drive rs and the signal structures have to be clear \\nof ,the moving dimensions. In electrified sections, however, the signals should have the required electrical \\nclearance  \\nof at least 2m from the live conductor. Detailed instructions on the location of signals h ave been issued by the \\nS&T Deptt.  \\n \\n2.   Where a signal post or its fittings have to be located within 2 m of live OHE, a screen of wore mesh of \\napproved design solidly connected with the structural work shall be provided between the signal post and the \\nOHE for protection of staff. Provision of such a screen is mandatory where non -technical staff like lamp -man \\nare required to climb up signal posts. The protection screen is not necessary when only the technical \\npersonnel, such as inspectors and maintainers o f the S&T Deptt. are authorised to work on the signals. When \\na screen is not provided for any reasons, a caution board of approved design shall be provided on the signal \\npost on the side facing the ladder at a height of 3 m above the rail level to caution such staff.  \\n \\n3.   Technical personnel shall exercise particular care to protect themselves while working on signal posts not \\nprovided with protective screens. If there is any likelihood of any part of their tools or equipment coming within \\n2 m of live equ ipment, they shall take a power block as detailed in Chapter Vi. The same precautions are also \\nrequired in the vicinity of return conductors, which should be treated as live. \\'  \\n \\n4.   To ensure maximum visibility of signals to the drivers, signal Posts shou ld be located on the side opposite \\nto that of traction masts as for as possible. Where this is not possible as in double line sections and station \\nyards, the following steps are taken to achieve maximum visibility from the Driver\\'s normal position in the \\ndriving cab.  \\n \\ni) The distance between the signal post and the  traction mast  shall be as large as possible. In case the \\ntraction mast is located in front of the signal post the distance between the traction mast and signal  post \\nshould not be less than 30 m. No traction mast shall be located beyond the signal post at a distance less than \\n10m.  \\n \\nii) The signal post should be sufficiently high so as to be seen clearly.  \\n \\n111) For deciding setting of mast near signals, para 20.5 of Appendix may be referred to.   \\n \\niv) On curved tracks or in areas where other obstructions such as buildings, trees, etc. exist the site is \\nindividually examined for deciding the most appropriate location of the signal.  \\n \\nV) In all cases a \"Signal Siting Committee\" which includes a rep resentative of the Electrical Department \\nshould be constituted to examine the visibility of the signal before finally deciding its location and height.  \\n \\n20704 insulation of Wires and Point Rods  \\n \\nNormally wires and point rods would be eliminated in the si gnalling system in ac electrified section. However, \\nwhere these exist, the wire transmission as well as point rods in ac electrified areas are subject to induced \\nvoltage which could reach high values when an OHE fault occurs. This induced voltage or rail v oltage is \\ntransmitted through the wires and point rods to the lever frame. Insulators are therefore, provided on the wires \\nand point rods for insulating them from rail potentials and induced voltages, in accordance with detailed \\ninstructions on the subject  laid down in Chapter XXII of Indian Railway Signal Engineering Manual issued by \\nS&T Department.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART     [149]  20705 Earthing of S&T Equipment  \\n \\nEarthing of the following equipment is essential on sections ele ctrified with 25 kV ac 50 Hz single \\nphase system the earthing being done in accordance with prescribed instructions.  \\na)   Signal posts provided with protective wire -mesh screens .  \\nb)   The lever frames and other metallic parts of the cabin in contact wit h, the lever frame, (This \\nincludes rail stagings wherever they are used. Where the electrical conductivity of the,joints of the \\nrail staging is doubtful the members are to be bonded at the joints.)  \\nc) Metallic sheaths wherever applicable and armouring of all underground cables. The earthing of \\nthe sheath and armouring of main cables at either end is a matter of paramount importance \\nbecause unless the cables are earthed properly at both ends it will not be possible to obtain the \\nscreening effect of the cabl e from induced voltages.  \\nd)Block instruments working on earth return through the respective block filters.  \\n e)   All telecommunication equipment.  \\nf)The surge arresters provided in block filters as well as those provided for telecommunication \\nequipment  \\nin switching stations.  \\n \\nThe telecommunication equipment may be connected to the same earth as the lever frames. Surge \\narresters may be connected to the earth for the cable sheath. In all other cases separate earths \\nshall be provided. The resistance of an e arth shall not exceed 10 ohms.  \\n \\n20706 Signalling & Telecommunication Cables  \\n \\nThe main S & T cable in ac electrified sections are usually of the PVC insulated, screened and \\narmoured type to IRS Specification No.,S -35. These cables are laid in accordance w ith instructions \\nissued by the S & T Department. Instructions which are likely to affect traction installations are given \\nbelow  \\n(i)    The cable is laid so that it is not less than lm from the nearest edge of the traction mast \\nfoundation provided that the  depth of the cable does not exceed 0.5 m. When the cable is laid at a \\ndepth greater than 0.5 m a minimum distance of 3 m shall be maintained between the cable and the \\nnearest edge of the traction mast foundation. If it is difficult to maintain these dista nces the cable \\nshall be laid in concrete pipes for distance of 3m on either side from the mast. When so laid the \\ndistance between the cable and foundation may be reduced to 0.5m. These precautions are \\nnecessary to avoid damage to the cable in the event of the failure of an overhead insulator.  \\n(ii)   In the vicinity of traction substations and feeding posts, the cable shall be laid at least lm away \\nfrom any metallic parts of the OHE and other equipment at the sub -station/ feeding post as well as \\nfrom the su bstation earthing system. In addition, the cables shall be laid in concrete pipes for a \\nlength of 300m on either side of the feeding post . As far as possible the cable shall be laid on the \\nside of the track opposite to the feeding post.  \\n(111)  In the vic inity of switching stations, the cable shall be laid in the ground at least lm away from \\nany metallic structure of the switching station and at least 5m away from the station earthing \\nsystem. The distance of 5 m can be reduced to lm provided the cable are laid in concrete pipes.  \\n(iv)   Where an independent earth is provided for an OHE mast/ structure i.e., where the mast is \\nconnected to a separate earth instead of being connected to the rail, the cables shall he laid \\'at least \\none metre away from the earth .  \\nv)     Where there are traction masts/structures along the cable route, the cable shall be laid in the \\ntrench which should be as far as possible but not less than 5.50 m from the centre of the track.  \\n(vi)   Where cables have to cross the track, concret e or GI pipes must be used for the crossing. The \\nuse of GI pipes or a form of metallic pipes is   prohibited within a distance of 300m from the feeding \\npost. Similarly galvanized iron metallic pipes are prohibited in close proximity to switching station \\nearths or traction masts.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOI UME 11 PART    [150]  \\n 20707 Block Instruments and Block Circuits  \\n \\nOn replacement of overhead communication lines with cables, block instruments working with \\noverhead lines with earth re turn are transferred to special PVC insulated quads in the underground \\ncables. Special protective devices are provided at both ends of block circuits for protection of the \\ninstruments as well as the operating staff.  \\n \\n20708 Track Circuits  \\n \\nAny of the foll owing types of track circuits may be used on ac electrified sections : -  \\n \\ni)dc single rail track circuits.  \\n \\nii) ac track circuits working at a frequency other than 50 Hz so as to be unaffected by the latter.  \\n \\niii) Voice frequency and other forms of elect ronic track circuits.  \\n \\nThe track circuits of (ii) and (iii) above may be either the double rail type or the single rail type.  \\n \\n20709 Bonding in Track Circuited Zones  \\n \\nThe track bonding for the passage of traction current requires modifications in the tr ack circuited \\nzones. Appendix 11 may  be referred to in this regard.  \\n \\n20710 Signalling and Inter -locking Circuits  \\n \\nIn view of the high level of electromagnetic and electrostatic induction in overhead lines, all \\noverhead lines used for signalling and inter  locking circuits in ac electrified sections have been \\nreplaced by underground cables. The replaced lines, if not dismantled before energization of the \\nOHE, shall be cut into sections and earthed at several places.  \\n \\nThe length of a circuit in a cable shal l be such that the induced voltage in the circuit does not \\nexceed 120 volts (corresponding to a parallelism of 3.5 km). If for any reason parallelism of a circuit \\nexceeds 3. 5 km, a relay is inserted in the circuit so that the physical continuity of the ca ble is \\nbroken and the parallelism of each portion is reduced to less than 3.5 km. If the parallelism in \\nexcess of 3.5 km is due to feeding two circuits from a common battery or power supply source, \\nseparate batteries are provided to feed the circuit on eac h side so as to limit the parallelism to less \\nthan 3.5 km.  \\n11. TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES FOR ac TRACTION  \\n20711 Telecommunication Circuits  \\n \\nThe telecommunication facilities provided in electrified sections have been detailed in \\nChapter 11 of Volume  \\n \\nOn ac electrified sections all overhead telecommunication lines running parallel to the track have to \\nbe replaced by underground cables. When the induced voltage in the cable is expected to exceed \\n60 volts; way station and subscriber\\'s equipment, exchanges are protected from the induced voltage \\nby providing isolating transformers. When transformers are provided it will not be possible to \\ntransfer dc. circuits such  as CB and auto telephones, dc telegraph circuits etc. , into the cable.  \\n \\nThe attenuation of sp eech in an overhead line of 56.S kg per km copper is approxirnateiyO.039 dB \\nper km whereas the attenuation in an underground long distance cable is approximately 0. 22 dB \\nper km. The telecommunication circuits are therefore subject to about five times the attenuation \\nwhen transferred to underground cables and consequently repeaters are required for these circuits \\nat intervals of about 50 to 6\\'0 km for satisfactory working. Where the cables are laid by the DOT all \\nrepeaters and isolating transformers are pro vided by them.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     1 51  \\n 20712 Principles of Tapping  \\n \\nTraction Power centre, Traction loco Control and emergency telephone circuits are specifically \\ninstalled for electric traction.

CLS supply panel having a three -position manual changeover \\nswitch shall be provided at one of the cabins by the Electrical Department, from where the supply \\nshall be extended by S&T department to other cabins.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    [153]   (iii)Provision of 2 nos. Auxiliary Transformers, one each connected to OHE of UP & DN lines, shall \\nbe arranged at each level crossing located more than 2 km away from the Railway station. If any \\nother level crossings are located w ithin 2 km of the level crossing where a set of ATs have been \\nprovided, then supply from the same ATs shall be extended to these level crossing through 2 x 25 \\nMM2. Aluminium cable to be laid by S & T Deptt. The CLS supply cable alongwith manual change -\\nover switch shall be provided at the gate lodge. Change -over shall be effected by the Gateman on \\nduty.  \\n(iv) In case of IBH, separate set of AT s shall be provided. As IBHs are unmanned, a two -position \\nautomatic change -over switch shall be provided.  \\n(v) In sin gle line sections, one AT connected to the OHE will be provided for supply to CLS. The LT \\nsupply will be extended from the AT to ASM\\'s ,room by means of 2 x 25 MM2. aluminium cable \\nterminated at the CLS supply panel. Local power supply, if available, will also be connected to this \\npanel, which will be provided with a change -over switch. This arrangement will be adopted for the \\nway side stations, level crossings beyond 2 km. from the nearest Railway Station and at the IBHS.   \\n(vi) At way -side electrified sta tions, where local supply is prone to prolonged interruptions, an \\nemergency light point shall be provided in ASM\\'s room and in each cabin from the AT supply, \\nthrough a separate circuit protected by a fuse of proper rating. At non -electrified stations, a se parate \\nlighting circuit shall be provided in ASM\\'s room and in each cabin from the AT supply. From the \\nlighting circuit in the ASM\\'s room, one light point each in ASM\\'s room, on the platform outside the \\nstation building, at the ticket window/waiting hall a nd in the cable hut shall be provided. On the \\nlighting circuit at the cabins, one light point each in the cabin, relay room, battery room and cabin \\nbasement shall be provided.  \\n(vii) All the power supply installations provided by the Electrical department, as detailed in paras (1) \\nto (vi) above, will be maintained by the Electrical department.  \\n \\n3. Following works shall be carried out by the S&T department  \\n(i) A 2 x 25 mm2 aluminium cable will be laid from the ASM\\'s room to each cabin alongwith the \\nsignal c ontrol cables in the same trench. An integrated power cubicles including a voltage stabilizer, \\ninverter and battery chargers will be provided in the relay room for signal and relay supplies. A 240 \\nV ac outlet from this power pack will be made available to Electrical Department for provision of light \\npoints. Similar arrangements will be made at each level crossing and IBH.  \\n \\n(ii) An 80 Ah battery capacity, sufficient to cater for two hours failure of supply, will be provided at \\neach, cabin and level crossing . One extra 80 Ah battery set shall be provided temporarily at these \\npoints until AT supply becomes available. At IBH 200 Ah battery capacity may be provided to cater \\nfor four hours failure of supply.  \\n(iii) At large yards, two standby diesel generating se ts of 1 0 kVA rating each will be -provided for \\nstandby power supply to the signalling installations. The supply from these generators will be \\nbrought to the CLS supply panel in the ASM\\'s room or in the cabin, where a change -over switch will \\nbe provided by  the S&T Deptt. to enable the ASM/Cabinman to affect the change -over supply from \\nthe normal mode to the generator mode. A push -button control will  also be provided in the ASM\\'s \\nroom/cabin to enable the ASM to start/stop standby diesel generator whenever re quired.                              \\n(iv) On sections where automatic block is planned, S&T will lay a power cable all along the section \\nwith suitable feeding arrangements - to suit local conditions.  \\n(V) At station where telecom repeater stations are locat ed, a 2 x 25 MM2 aluminium cable will be \\nlaid from the  CLS supply panel in the ASM\\'s room to the repeater station to avail AT supply to work \\nbattery chargers and repeater equipments in the \\'event of failure of local supply. Electrical \\nDepartment will prov ide a change -over switch at the repeater station between AT supply and local \\nsupply. An emergency light point shall also be provided at Repeater stations by Electrical \\nDepartment from the AT supply.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [154]  \\n 2.   In the event of power block being given on both the OHE sub -sectors from which the signal \\nsupply is derived, electric traffic would necessarily have to be suspended on the line. During such \\nperiods, colour light signalling will not also be in operation. Such cases are likely to arise very rarely \\nat any station and the duration of the block is not like to exceed one hour at a time. Therefore, no \\nadditional power supply arrangement need be made by the Electrical Department at wayside \\nstations. Ho wever, to cater for this condition, portable stand -by sets should be kept by the S&T \\nDepartment to be operated until 25 kV supply is restored. At large stations with considerable \\nshunting movements, a stand -by diesel generator set may be installed by the S &T Department to \\nmeet emergencies, If considered essential.  \\n \\n111. PERMANENT WAY INSTALLATIONS  \\n \\n20714 Major Track Maintenance Works  \\n \\n1.   An authorised OHE staff should invariably be present, when relaying work or any major work on \\ntrack is  carried out, I n order to ensure the following points:  \\n \\n(i) Power block is correctly taken and permit to work is issued;  \\n \\n(ii) The structure bonds, track bonds, cross bonds, longitudinal rail bonds etc. are not disturbed and \\nif disconnected for the work, they are recon nected properly when the work is completed.  \\n \\n(iii) The return feeder connections to the rails at the feeding posts are proper and not disturbed.  \\n \\n(IV) The setting distance of the structure is not affected during slewing  \\n \\n(V) The track level is not raise d beyond the permissible limits during the work;  \\n \\n(Vi) Excavation or digging near a mast foundation is done in such a manner that the foundation is \\nnot exposed;  \\n \\n(Vii) The clearance particularly at overline structure is maintained to the required standar ds;  \\n \\n(viii) Precautions for the safety of staff working under the OHE are taken correctly.  \\n \\nThe Engineering officials in charge of such major work shall ensure that intimation to their \\ncounterparts for OHE maintenance work is given with adequate notice.  \\n \\n20715 New Sections to be Electrified  \\n \\nEngineering staff working in section being electrified should be specially trained and instructed in \\nregard to working  \\nin electrified sections well in time (Para 20972).  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION M ANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    (155)  \\n   \\n CHAPTER VIII  \\nBREAKDOWNS  \\n \\n1. GENERAL  \\n \\n20800 Knowledge of Rules  \\nAll  Officers and Supervisors of the Traction Branch should be fully conversant with the \"Rules for \\nReporting Accidents\" and other instruction s in force for dealing with accidents and breakdowns. The \\ninstructions given in the following paragraphs are to be treated as supplementary instructions \\napplicable specifically to traction installations; they should not be taken as nullifying or contradict ing \\nthe instructions contained in other official manuals.  \\n \\nElectrical accidents are dealt with in the Volume  \\n \\n20801 Types of Breakdowns  \\n \\nThe types of break -downs pertaining to electric traction can be broadly divided into the following \\ncategories: -  \\n \\n1 Sub-stations and switching stations  \\n \\n2Remote control equipment and cables  \\n \\n3 OHE feeder lines and transmission lines  \\n \\n20802 Breakdown Gangs  \\n \\nAccidents and breakdowns involving traction installations and electric rolling -stock should normally \\nbe attende d to by -the maintenance gangs themselves. It is, however, essential that adequate \\nnumber of experienced traction staff should be selected and housed in railway quarters close to \\ntraction installations, so that their services can be utilized at short notice  for dealing with \\nbreakdowns and accidents whenever required.  \\n \\nIn electrified suburban sections, however, \\'breakdown gangs\\' of adequate strength may he located \\nat selected points to deal promptly with OHE failures, particularly during the hours of peak tr affic.  \\n \\n20803 Emergency Stores and Breakdown Equipment  \\n \\n1.   For each OHE depot/sub -depot, the actual quantity of OHE stores like masts, conductors, \\ninsulators, fittings etc. which should be earmarked specially for use in breakdowns will be laid down \\nby Sr. DEE (TrD). To start with, all materials required for 3 kilometres of single line may be kept. \\nBased on experience, the minimum and maximum quantities may be, revised from time to time. An \\ninventory of such OHE stores should be maintained by the supervi sor-in-charge of the depot/sub -\\ndepot and stocks recouped periodically so as to ensure that the minimum quantity is always \\navailable. During periodic inspections by officers, scrutiny of this inventory should be one of the \\nimportant items in order that the required stores are always made available.                                \\n \\n2.   OHE Inspection Cars, wiring trains, breakdown lorries and all break -down tools, tackles, \\nstraining screws, clamps, ladders etc. shall be maintained in good condition and kept r eady for use \\nat all times. Though it will be the primary responsibility of the supervisor in -charge of the OHE \\ndepot/sub -depot to ensure that all breakdown equipment is in good working order, supervisors and \\nofficers at all levels should specially check th eir condition during their periodical inspections. A \\nperiodic review should also be made regarding the adequacy of such spares and tools.                                                                        \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME  11 PART 1    (158)  \\n 3.   The CTFO (PSI) and CTFO (RC) should also have in their custody spares and tools pertaining \\nto their work as per scale to be laid down by Sr. DEE (TrD) for dealing with breakdowns and \\naccidents.  \\n \\n20804 Record of Staff Movements  \\nTPC should, even when everything is normal, keep a continuous record of the movements of \\nmaintenance gangs so that he can contact the gangs immediately whenever required to attend to \\nany emergency. All senior supervisors and officers of the Traction Distri bution Branch should also \\nkeep the TPC informed of their movements. These Instructions also apply to off -duty hours for \\nofficers, senior supervisors and key personnel.  \\n \\n20805 Summoning of Emergency Staff  \\nTo enable the TPC to summon staff as required, a r egister showing the residential addresses of \\nspecified staff of the Traction Distribution branch, particularly those residing in railway quarters or \\nclose to railway stations, should be maintained station -wise by TPC. The list of office and residential \\ntelephone numbers of officers and supervisors should also be kept up -to-date by him for ready \\nreference. In view of the importance of communication facilities in an emergency every telephone \\nshould be tested at least once a month.  \\n \\n11. SUB -STATION AND SWITCH ING STATION BREAK -DOWNS  \\n20806 Traction Transformer Breakdowns  \\n \\nBreakdown of any one traction transformer or associated circuit breaker at a traction sub -station \\n(whether owned by the Supply Authority or the Railway) should not normally affect the working since \\n100% stand -by is available for the transformer at nearly all sub -stations.  \\n \\n20807 Central Repair Shop  \\n \\nFailure of traction transformers, requiring the lifting of core and winding are extremely rare. \\nHowever, repair and overhaul facilities should be  provided at a central point on each railway. At \\neach Central Repair Shop, the following facilities are generally required (Reference may also be \\nmade to the Appendix VI to this Volume):  \\n \\n1.   A crane bay with the railway line leading into it, so that the  traction transformer may be brought \\nin directly into it. The crane hook should be high enough to permit unloading of the transformer from \\nthe wagons and placing on the floor, and also for lifting the core out of the transformer tank.  \\n \\n2. Two underground transformer oil storage tanks, one for old oil and one for new oil.  \\n3 A 2500 litre/hour, electrically driven oil purification plant with pumps and interconnecting pipes and \\nvalves to empty old oil from transformers, to fill  new, purified oil into the tran sformers, to dry out the \\noil in the transformers etc., as required.  \\n \\n4.  An enclosure with oil testing set to test dielectric strength of oil.  \\n \\n5. A small workshop with a few essential machines to carry out urgent repair work.  \\n \\n6.   A test -room and labo ratory fully equipped with testing equipment for carrying out repair, \\ncalibration and testing of all types of relays and instruments used on the traction system.  \\n \\n20808 Mobile Power Van  \\nA mobile power van should also be provided on each railway which has  to maintain traction \\ntransformers. On this the following equipment should be provided:  \\n \\n1. -*An engine -generator set rated to deliver 100 kVA at 415 ac 50 Hz, 3 -phase 4 -wiree along With \\nnecessary  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     159  oil storage tanks.  \\n2. A 2500 litres/hour electrically driven oil purification Plant.  \\n3.   A small mobile, workshop to attend to urgent on -the-spot repair work, comprising a motor driven \\ndrilling machine, grinding machine, a power driven hacksaw, a welding machine and oxyacetylene \\nflame cutting equipment.  \\n4. Portable floodlights with trailing cables to light up  accident sites to facilitate repair work.  \\n \\nThe mobile van can be used for purifying transformer oil of traction transformers in situ when \\nrequired, eliminating the need for bringing the transformers to the Central Repair Shop. At stations \\nwhere no 3 -phage, 4 1 5 V supply is available from a nearby source, the engine set is operated to \\nmeet the heater load of the oil purification plant and al so to drive the motors. The mobile van would \\nalso be useful to flood -light an area such as when there is an extensive OHE breakdown.  \\n \\n20809 Breakdown of Circuit Breakers, Interruptors  \\n \\nIf a circuit breaker or interrupter requires major repairs, it should  be brought to the PSl maintenance \\ndepot after replacing it by a spare one.  \\n \\n20810 Rail and Road Access  \\n \\nEvery traction sub -station should have all -weather road access in addition to rail access for \\ntransporting heavy equipment to and from the installati ons. For switching stations too, road access \\nshould be provided wherever possible. Suitable fittings and tackle should be available to move an \\nInterrupter or circuit breaker from the PSI maintenance depot on a motor trolley or OHE Inspection \\nCar and unload  it by the side of any switching station and take it in. A suitable platform and a firm \\npathway leading to the gate should be available and maintained well.  \\n \\n111. BREAKDOWNS OF REMOTE, CONTROL EQUIPMENT  \\n20811 Procedure for Manning Sub -Stations And Switchi ng Stations  \\n \\n1.   Whenever Remote Control working is not possible due to any fault on the P & T cable or in the \\nremote control equipment concerned or failure of the battery etc. CTFO (RC) or TPC shall suspend \\nremote control operation of the particular sec tion or switching station concerned until  the defect is \\nrectified. During this period it is necessary to arrange for manning the switching stations by posting \\nsuitably qualified staff, who are authorized to carry out emergency switching operations manuall y as \\ninstructed by TPC. Such staff will be referred to as \\'Operator\\' in the following paragraphs. To meet \\nsuch emergencies, TPC shall maintain a register of authorized operators, who have been trained, \\nexamined and declared by AEE (TRD) as competent.  \\n \\n2.    Whenever an operator is placed on duty at a switching post when the remote control equipment \\nis not functioning due to any reason, the following instructions shall be adhered to: -  \\n(a) Before taking over his duty, the Operator shall make himself conversant with the equipment he \\nis required to operate and the rules that are laid down  by the Administration for operation  of the \\nequipment.  \\n(b)   He shall carry out orders issued to him by TPC over the telephones observing the rules  laid \\ndown for exchange of t elephone messages.  \\n(C)   He shall maintain a log book showing the details of operations carried out by him in   the order \\nin which they were done, interruption to power supply, abnormal occurrences, defects in plant \\nrequiring attention, and other informat ion if any. The log will be signed by both the relieving and \\nrelieved Operators at every change of shift as a token of having taken over and handed over all \\nequipment correctly.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME ii PART    [160]   (d) The Oper ator shall be responsible for all the plant and equipment, spare parts, stores and \\nfurniture (at the sub -station or switching station) during his shift,  \\n(e)Whenever a switching station is manned, the Operators shall work in accordance with the duty \\nroster s exhibited. The regulation of the shifts shall be effected by TPC.  \\n \\n(f)The operator on shift duty is forbidden to leave the post station unless he is relieved by an \\nauthorised person .No interchange of duties or variation of duty hours is permitted witho ut the prior \\npermission of TPC and staff who are unable from any cause to take their shift shall at once notify  \\n \\n(g) Whenever an Operator is posted at a switching station or sub -station he shall always be \\naccompanied by another person e.g., a Khalasi, who  can use the telephone intelligently.  \\n \\n \\n20812 Restoration of Remote Control  \\n \\nCTFO (RC) shall arrange for expeditious rectification of the defect and restoration of remote control. \\nIt is  undesirable to continue any controlled post on local control for pr olonged periods.  \\n \\n20813 Breakdown of Tele -Communication Between TPC and Sub -Stations, Switching \\nStations etc .  \\n \\nIf  the TPC circuit becomes defective for any reason, several alternative channels of \\ntelecommunication are available. Should the P & T cable i t self breakdown all circuits through it may \\nbe in operative in such cases , essential messages may be passed through P & T telephones, \\nRailway local telephones network , Railway wireless network or microwave network.Urgent \\nmessages from TPC to traction su b stations could also be passed through the operators of grid sub \\nstations.  \\nClose co -ordination should be maintained between the officials of the Traction Distribution Branch, \\nS&T branch and DOT authorities to ensure quick restoration of normal communicati on facilities.  \\n \\nIV. OHE BREAKDOWNS  \\n \\n20814 Importance of Expeditious Repairs  \\n \\nEvery breakdown of OHE , even if minor in nature , should be attended to urgently as it is generally \\ninterferes with traffic. Since electrified lines carry a high density of tra ffic , the effect on traffic will be \\nquite severe if restoration is not arranged expeditiously.  \\n \\n20815 Types of OHE Breakdowns  \\n \\nThe common types of OHE breakdowns are as under -  \\n1. Uprooting of or damage to OHE masts on account of cyclone, derailments etc.,  \\n2. Entanglement of pantographs with the OHE,  \\n3. Snapping of OHE - conductors,  \\n4. Flash -over or other damage to insulators,  \\n5. Faults on account of stray wires etc.,  \\n6.   Theft of OHE conductors.                         \\n \\n20816 Look -out for OHE Defects  \\n \\nThe engine crew of all trains should keep a sharp look -out and report to the TPC from the nearest \\nstation any defects noticed by them in the OHE.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [161]  All break -downs or defects in OHE which are likely to af fect the train services, noticed by any \\nRailway servant, shall be reported immediately to TPC. If TPC cannot be contacted, the nearest \\nStation Master or Cabin Assistant Station Master shall be advised\\' The SM/CASM to whom such \\nbreakdowns or defects are rep orted shall convey the information immediately to TPC through the \\ncontrol or other available telephone. The person reporting a breakdown to TPC should give as \\ndetailed Information as possible on the nature of the breakdown, its location, if masts have been  \\nuprooted or both lines in a double track section have been affected etc.  \\n \\nThe person conveying the information to TPC should not leave the vicinity of the telephone without \\nTPC\\'s permission, as the latter may want to contact him again to elicit further i nformation.  \\n \\n20817 Action to be taken by TPC  \\nIf required, TPC shall direct the nearest available Electrical Department official to proceed to site to \\nobtain full details. Simultaneously the TPC should switch off power supply to the affected lines and \\ninform the Section Controller.  \\n \\nThough initially power may have to be switched off over a whole sub -sector, the faulty elementary \\nsection should be identified and isolated as quickly as possible so that power supply may be \\nrestored to the healthy sections an d. normal train operation resumed.                                                  \\n \\nFurther, it should be possible in many cases to block the lines for electric locos and EMUs only, \\npermitting movement of steam and diesel trains. It may also be possible t o move electric locos and \\nEMUs at restricted speed or to coast through the affected section with pantographs lowered if the \\ndamage is only slight. It is for TPC to decide after careful study of information available from the site \\nand In consultation with t raffic officials the extent of restriction to be imposed on, traffic.  \\n \\n20818 Protective Steps  \\n \\n1.   On receipt of information about OHE break -down, the SM/Section Controller shall also take such \\nsteps as deemed necessary to regulate traffic on the affect ed lines and issue caution order where \\nrequired. Single line working may be introduced, if feasible.  \\n \\n2.   It is the duty of every railway servant who notices hanging OHE conductors to take immediate \\npreventive steps to ensure that no person comes into co ntact with them treating such conductors as \\nlive until an authorized person from OHE section arrives at site and makes the OHE dead and earth \\nit.  \\n20819 Breakdown Staff  \\n1.   On receipt of the first report about the breakdown, TPC shall direct the nearest OHE \\nmaintenance gang to proceed to site immediately with available breakdown vehicles for dispatch of \\nstaff without waiting for full details of the breakdown.  \\n \\n2.   A quick assessment should be made on the basis of information available and where necessar y \\none or more gangs from both sides of the site may be asked to proceed to the site. If the accident \\nspot cannot be reached by railway vehicles on account of the line being blocked by other trains, \\nroad vehicles equipped with emergency stores, tools and st aff may be directed to the site. In sub -\\nurban sections with large number of roads running along side the track, this method may help in \\ntackling the repairs much more quickly.  \\n \\n3.    If the OHE Inspection Car or wiring train is required to attend to the b reak-down, the Section \\nController, on request from TPC shall arrange for quick passage of the OHE Inspection Car or \\nwiring train to the site of the accident.                                                                                   \\n \\n20820 Officers and supervisors to Proceed to Site  \\nOn receipt of information about an OHE breakdown the ATFO(OHE), \\nCTFO(OHE),DEE/AEE(TrD) shall  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [162]  Proceed by quickest available means to the scene of accident.  The Sr. DEE(TRD) should also \\nproceed to the site if the circumstances of the case require his personal supervision and direction. In \\nthe event of a major break -down likely to result in interruption of traffic for more than 12 h, CEDE \\nshould also proceed t o the site for supervising restoration.  \\n20821 Assistance to be sought  \\n1.   It should be remembered that restoration of traffic in the event of accident or breakdown is the \\nresponsibility of the Division as a whole. The Electrical Department Officer in -charge of the \\nrestoration work should, wherever required, ask for assistance from the Engineering, Traffic or other \\nOfficers as necessary. He should also keep the DRM fully posted with arrangements made and the \\nexpected time of restoration.  \\n \\n2.   When circu mstances warrant, the assistance of OHE gangs of another contiguous Division may \\nbe sought for by contacting AEE(TRD) or Sr.DEE/DEE(TRD) of the Division concerned. The \\nOfficers who receive such requests from neighboring divisions should treat the matter as  of utmost \\nimportance and render all possible assistance.  \\n \\n20822 Continuous Communication with TPC  \\nThe Officer or Supervisor in -charge of supervising repair work should maintain continuous \\ncommunication with the TFIC from the site of breakdown. For this purpose an intelligent person \\nshould be posted to man the nearest emergency telephone socket continuously to transmit and \\nreceive messages as required. It is very important that the field staff remains on call all the time until \\nnormal service is restored,  since no provision exists in the emergency telephone circuit for the TPC \\nto ring up the emergency telephone stations at the site.  \\n \\n20823 Detailed Assessment by the First Supervisor/Officer Reaching Site  \\nThe first Supervisor or Officer of the Traction Br anch reaching the  site of the breakdown should \\nmake a quick assessment of the extent of damage and the time required for restoration. He will \\nascertain from TPC the details of break -down gangs and equipment directed to the site and if the \\ncircumstances wa rrant, ask for additional gangs and breakdown equipment to be sent to the site. \\nOn receipt of these details, TPC should arrange for additional gangs and equipment to be sent to \\nthe site expeditiously. In the meanwhile, isolation and repair works should be started at site.  \\n \\nFurther details on the extent of damage and estimated time as obtained from the Supervisor/Officer \\nat the site from time to time will be passed on from TPC to the Section Controller to enable him to \\nreview the arrangement for regulating the traffic initially made.  \\n \\nIn the event of major breakdowns affecting main line traffic, Sr. DOM/DOM of the Division should \\npersonally take over regulation of traffic arrangements.  \\n \\n20824 Preservation of Evidence  \\n \\nWhen a pantograph gets entangled with  the OHE, it is often very difficult to establish whether the \\ndamage originated from a faulty pantograph or a defect on the OHE.  \\n \\nThe first Officer or Supervisor of the Electrical Department arriving at site of a breakdown \\nparticularly those involving ent anglement of pantographs with the OHE, should make a very careful \\nnote of all relevant details pertaining to the breakdown and also prepare a sketch indicating the \\nparticulars. He will also arranges for preservation of such evidence as may be useful subseq uently \\nfor investigating the cause of the breakdown.  \\n \\nItems to be checked on the pantograph and OHE are indicated in the Annexure 8.01 and 8.02.  \\n20825 Safety Rules to be Observed  \\nWhile speed is the essence of emergency working, rules prescribed for safe  working shall never be \\ninfringed.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART    [163]  Repair work may commence only after an emergency power block has been obtained and all other \\nprecautions necessary for protection of the staff taken. On compl etion of the repair work, the power \\nblock may be cancelled according to the prescribed procedure.  \\n20826 Temporary Repairs for Restoration of Traffic  \\nIn the first instance, repairs to the OHE should be kept to the barest minimum necessary for \\nrestoration of traffic with least possible delay. Work must proceed simultaneously at many points. \\nAfter effecting temporary repairs, the Officer or Supervisor in -charge of the work should personally \\ncheck the whole area and satisfy himself that the Installations are in order and safe. He may impose \\nsuch speed restriction as necessary for movement of electric and other than electric trains till \\npermanent repairs are carried out. Permanent repairs should be arranged and speed restrictions \\nremoved and normal operation re stored at the earliest opportunity.                -  \\n \\n20827 Clearance of Line for Steam/Diesel Traction  \\nIf the breakdown is extensive and restoration of electric traction is unlikely in a short time even with \\ntemporary repairs, the line should be cleared  for diesel/steam traction as soon as possible, so that \\ntraffic may be kept moving until repairs to the OHE are completed. After steam/diesel traction is \\nintroduced full precautions should be taken for protection of staff working at site.  \\n \\n20828 Wring Tra in  \\nIf the OHE has suffered extensive damage, the OHE wring train should be requisitioned to speed up \\nthe work.  \\n \\nThe wiring train generally consists of a stores -cum-tool van, a workshop van, a  staff and kitchen \\nvan, a reel wagon loaded with one drum of c atenary wire and one drum of contact wire, wagon \\nloaded with materials for temporary diversions, a BFR loaded with structures, a hand -operated \\ncrane to facilitate erection of masts, a power car with two diesel generator sets for supplying power \\nto the work shop van and for lighting, two brake vans, an adequate quantity of OHE material and \\nflood -lights with trailing cables. The vans have platforms with side -railings to facilitate working on the \\nroof.  \\n \\n20829 Interference with OHE During Restoration  \\nIn cleari ng the line for traffic, breakdown staff are forbidden to disturb the OHE masts or to cut the \\nOHE conductors except under the specific orders of Sr. DEE(TrD)/DEE(TrD). If it becomes \\nnecessary to slew the OHE conductors to facilitate crane working, this sho uld be arranged to be \\ndone by the Electrical Department staff. It should be borne in mind that indiscriminate cutting of \\nOHE conductors will necessitate Introduction of splices which are not conducive to good current \\ncollection. Also introduction of such s plices is liable to delay restoration of normal electric services.  \\n \\n20830 Temporary Diversions  \\nSometimes with derailments and accidents occurring in electrified sections, temporary diversions \\nhave to be laid to clear the traffic with other than electric traction. A quick means of wiring such \\ndiversions so as to resume electric traction without waiting for the main line to be commissioned is \\ndescribed  below.  \\n \\nThe constructional details of the arrangement for such diversions on BG may be seen in Fig.8.01.   \\n \\nThe portal type structures are made out of 8Ornm diameter GI pipes using two right angled \\'T\\' joints. \\nGuys are used in both perpendicular and parallel directions to the track so as to give extra safety \\nagainst heavy wind load. The contact wire is  suspen ded with the help of special fittings made of MS \\nflats form the catenary wire stretched between the two uprights of the structure and insulated by two \\n9-tonne insulators as shown in the figure.  \\n \\nThe 80 mm diameter GI pipes are placed in 15Omm diameter MS pipes welded on to a 1Omm thick \\n45Omm X 45Omm MS base plate which in turn is bolted by 1Omm diameter through bolts to a \\n488Omm long crossing sleeper  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [164]   The contact wire is anchored at both ends at a height of 6 m on existing masts and \\'fly guys\\' are \\nprovided from the anchor mast to the base of the next mast so that no separate foundation is \\nnecessary for anchoring and also the guy can be removed easily at the time of dism antling.  \\n \\n-The advantages of the above type of construction are as under  \\n \\n1. It is cheap.  \\n \\n2. The structures weigh less than 150 kg and 4 men can easily erect or dismantle them,  \\n \\n3.   Since no foundations are required, time is not lost in excavation fo r foundation and consequently \\nthe structures can be erected quickly.  \\n \\n4. The equipment can be dismantled and erected at new sites quickly.  \\n \\n5.   The traffic can move at the speed restriction imposed for the permanent way and no extra speed \\nrestriction on  account of  OHE is necessary.  \\n \\n6.   The materials used for the work are easily obtainable the new fabrications required can easily \\nbe manufactured in workshops and stocked at depots for quick use in emergencies.  \\n \\n20831 Funds Required for Dealing with Br eakdowns  \\n \\nFunds required for dealing with breakdowns may be obtained from station earnings in accordance \\nwith para 7 14 of the Indian Railways Permanent Way Manual reproduced below: -  \\n \\n(1) The Divisional/District Engineer or the Assistant Engineer on his  behalf may drew upon the \\nstation earnings according to such instructions as prescribed by the Administration under note to \\npara 1405G, for the following purposes: -  \\n \\n(a) Payment to daily labour employed at the site of breach or accident.  \\n \\n(b) Purchase of  tools or materials required in connection with accidents which cannot be supplied in \\ntime by the Stores Department.  \\n \\n(C) To provide food to engineering labour at the site of breach or accident with the assistance of \\nStation Masters or Inspectors of the C ommercial Department.  \\n \\nThe supply of food free of charge is permitted in special circumstances at the discretion of the \\nAdministration to facilitate expeditious restoration of traffic.  \\n \\nWhen food is supplied free at the site of an accident to engineering  and other labour the expenditure \\nper head per day shall not exceed the prescribed limit.  \\n \\n2. The Accounts Officer should be advised immediately by telegram of each sum taken from station \\nearnings.  \\n \\nIn all cases, Engineers obtaining advances from station  earnings should, do so under a clear \\nreceipt. On the receipt, the object for which the money has been procured should be clearly stated.  \\n \\nA complete account should be submitted at the earliest possible date to the accounts department \\nsupported by pay she ets and vouchers.  \\n \\n3. All pay1ments to labour should be witnessed .by the Assistant Engineer at site.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    166  20832 Log of Events and Reporting of Breakdowns  \\n \\n1.   In all major break -downs TPC, seni or officials and Officers concerned shall maintain a detailed \\nlog of events in their diaries noting the time and brief details which may help in fixing the \\nresponsibility for any avoidable delay in restoration.  \\n \\n2.   The DRM should submit to CEE and COM a  detailed report covering every major breakdown of \\nOHE or other traction installations giving all essential information including -  \\n1.   nature of break -downs and lines affected with detailed sketch;  \\n \\n2. chronological account of action taken to effect rep airs and restore traffic;  \\n \\n3. repercussions on traffic and rough estimated cost for repairing the damage;  \\n \\n4. cause of breakdown and staff responsible, if any;  \\n \\n5. any other special features including an objective analysis of the time taken for repairs and \\nrestoration of traffic with a view to see if these could have been done more expeditiously and if so \\nmeasures proposed to improve the performance in future.  \\n \\n20833 Protection of Staff  \\n \\nIn addition to ensuring that work on OHE is commenced only after obtaining a power block as stated \\nin para 20825 above, the supervisor in -charge shall take all measures for protection of staff and for \\nexhibition of hand -signals as per GR and SR, particularly when the line under repair and the \\nadjacent lines are not bloc ked for other traffic.  \\n \\n20834 Use of Cranes  \\n \\nSpecial care is necessary when steam or hand cranes are used at the site of break -downs. The \\nmovements of the cranes shall be carefully controlled by the person in -charge so as not to come \\nwithin 2 m of live O HE, in addition to the usual precautions necessary to prevent infringement of \\nadjacent tracks which have not been blocked for other traffic.  \\n \\nV. ROAD VEHICLES  \\n20835 Use of Road Vehicles during Emergencies  \\n \\nRoad vehicles like motor trucks and jeeps availa ble with maintenance officials should be maintained \\nin proper condition at all times, as they are liable to be called for use in attending to breakdowns or \\nemergencies. The essential rules for operation of road vehicles are given in the following paras.  \\n \\n20836 Driver\\'s Duties  \\n \\n1.   No person shall drive a vehicle belonging to the railway unless he has a proper license and is \\nduly authorized. No vehicle shall be driven on a public road unless the necessary tax has been paid \\nto the Licensing Authority for t he area as prescribed by the Motor Vehicles Act.  \\n \\n2.   Every Driver of a vehicle shall familiarize himself and comply with the traffic laws prevailing in \\nthe area, where. he operates. He shall be liable to disciplinary action for any  willful violation th ereof.  \\n \\n3. Before operating any vehicle the Driver shall make sure that it is in a proper operating condition \\nas follows  \\n(a) Test brakes, steering gear, clutch, horn and lights.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [167]  (b) See that the tyres are in good condition and properly inflated.  \\n(c)  Check emergency equipment e.g., first aid kit jack and tools.  \\n(d) Ensure that requisite quantities of petrol, lubricating oil and water are available in the vehicle.  \\n \\nDrivers shall test the head and  the tail lights before undertaking night driving. They shall not \\nundertake driving until these are in order.  \\n \\n4.   If any major defect is noticed during a journey, it shall be reported to the Electrical Foreman \\nconcerned immediately, and the vehicle shal l not be operated until the defect has been set right.  \\n \\n5.   Before filling the petrol tank the engine shall be shut off. The hose nozzle shall be kept in \\ncontact with the tank o avoid static sparks.  \\nWhile filling petrol tanks of the vehicles, smoking an d use of open flames shall not he permitted near \\nthe vehicle.  \\n \\n6. \\'Left -hand -drive\\' vehicles shall have these words written and displayed conspicuously at the back.  \\n \\n7.   All loaded trucks, carrying loads projecting beyond the rear end of the body shall carry red flags \\nof approved type and size when driving during day -time and red lights placed at extreme ends of the \\nloads or trailers at night.  \\n \\n8. Drivers shall not drive vehicles while in a drunken state.  \\n \\n20837 Opeiration of Road Vehicles  \\n \\n1. When lo ading or unloading vehicles, the emergency parking brakes shall be applied and the \\nwheels blocked.  \\n2.    Equipment, materials and tools carried on vehicles shall be properly secured and arranged so \\nas not to obstruct the view of the Driver or to interfere  with his giving traffic signals.  \\n3.   The vehicle shall be operated within prescribed speed limits. The speed shall be reasonably \\nreduced, where necessary, due to bad weather, poor visibility, heavy traffic and the conditions of the \\nroad and the Driver.  \\n4.   Drivers shall keep at a safe distance from vehicles in front. They shall not attempt to overtake \\nany vehicle unless they can see far enough to be sure of passing safely and until the horn signal \\ngiven for this purpose has been accepted by the Driver of the vehicle in front.  \\n5.   Drivers shall not attempt to pass other vehicles on curves, grades, street intersections or such \\nother places where the view is not clear.  \\n6. No motor vehicle shall be driven past school buses that are taking in or putting d own children.  \\n7.    Drivers shall, at night, dim lights when meeting other vehicles. When blinded by glaring \\nheadlights they shall slow down and, if necessary, stop until the vehicle has crossed.  \\n8 \\'When  fire department vehicles, ambulances or police pa trols are heard or observed approaching \\nfrom any direction, vehicles shall be stopped at a safe place until these vehicles have passed.  \\n9 .  When proceeding down a grade the clutch shall not be disengaged. The engine shall be \\nthrottled.  \\n10. When approach ing railway crossings and road intersections, Drivers shall slow down speed and \\nbe prepared to stop.  \\n \\n11. On slippery roads, Drivers, shall operate at a much lower speed and keep a safe distance from \\nvehicles in front to enable them to make a stop within safe limits, leaving the vehicle in gear and \\napplying the brakes until speed has been retarded sufficiently to engage the clutch without danger \\nof skidding.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     168  12. Drivers shall anticipate the i ntentions of other Drivers and pedestrians and shall themselves give \\nclear signals of their intentions regarding stopping or turning. They shall make allowance for lack of \\nskill or improper attitude on the part of other Drivers, pedestrians, children and a nimals. They shall \\nnot frighten or annoy them by hooting too frequently.                               \\n \\n13. When moving a vehicle in reverse direction make sure that the rear is clear and free. Under poor \\nvisibility or an hilly or congested roads, driver s hall employ a signal -man.  \\n \\n14. Horns shall be used only when necessary. Use of horn just near the object is dangerous and \\nshall be avoided.  \\n \\n15. Doors, tall gates, or parts of load of a vehicle shall not be kept dangling when the vehicle is  in \\nmotion.  \\n \\n16. The number of persons riding with the Driver shall not exceed the number of seats actually \\nprovided.  \\n \\n20838 Precautions when Transporting Heavy Materials   \\n \\n1.   Drivers of trucks carrying heavy structures or long ladders equipped with booms shall not drive \\nwith such equipment in an elevated or partially elevated position.  \\n2.    Proper  precautions shall be taken at all times to prevent contact with overhead lines, trees or \\nstructures.  \\n3.    In transporting material, particular care shall be exercised  to see that material mall not shift or \\nfall from the vehicle.  \\n4.   Where poles or the long sections of material projecting beyond the vehicle are to be transported \\nalong public roads, a red. flag in day -time or a red light at night shall be fastened to t he end of the \\nprojection.  \\n \\n20839 Transportation of Personnel  \\n \\n1.   The number of employees carried in vehicles shall not exceed the prescribed limit and they shall \\nbe provided with proper sitting arrangements.  \\n2.   Persons who are not employed in the ra ilway shall not be allowed to use the vehicles unless \\nspecifically permitted.  \\n3.   A person shall not put any part of his body outside the vehicles and shall not sit or stand on the \\nrung-board or other outside projections of the vehicle when in motion to avoid injury from other \\nvehicles.  \\n4. Employees shall not enter or leave the vehicle when it is in motion.  \\n5. Employees shall not ride on a load of poles or, other material carried on vehicles in a dangerous \\nway.  \\n6.   Vehicles fully loaded with personnel  shall not be started or stopped suddenly with a jerk, except \\nunder emergency conditions.  \\n \\n20840 Parking  \\n1.   Vehicles should be parked on the correct side close to kerb of the road so as not to interfere \\nwith traffic. Vehicles shall not be parked on bri dges, road curves, culverts and Intersections:  \\n \\n2.   When parking on a grade, the vehicle shall be in gear, hand -brakes, applied wheels turned \\ntowards the kerb. Bricks or stones shall be placed in the wheel path on the down grade side so that \\nthe vehicle cannot accidentally roll down.  \\n \\n3. When parking along a highway at night, parking lights shall be left on, but dirnrned. If any repair \\nwork is to  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUM.E 11 PART 1     169  be done, flares shall be set at opposite e nds so as to be visible from a distance of at least 150m to \\nwarn other Drivers in advance.  \\n \\n4.   When parking on the highway near another vehicle on the opposite side of the road, sufficient \\nclearance shall be kept between the two vehicles.  \\n \\n5.   Before leaving a parked vehicle, Drivers shall take with them the ignition key to prevent theft or \\nunauthorized starting of the vehicle.                                                              1  \\n \\n6.   Before changing tyres or making any other repairs along a highway, the Drivers shall pull off the \\nvehicle to the side of the road at a safe distance from the running traffic.  \\n \\n7.   When leaving or entering a parked vehicle, kerb side doors alone shall be used. If the doors \\nopen on roadside, look back and make sure that no vehicle is approaching from the rear.  \\n8 .  Before starting a parked vehicle, the Driver shall observe the front and the rear to ensure that \\nthere are no persons or objects in the way.  \\n \\n \\n20841 Maintenance of Road Vehicles  \\n \\n1.   Road vehicles  are costly and should be driven carefully and maintained efficiently. The \\nForeman -in-charge shall inspect every vehicle under his control at least once a fortnight, and \\narrange to have the defects noticed rectified promptly.  \\n \\n2.   Every emergency vehicle  shall also be inspected by an AEE once a month and by the DEE once \\nin six months and the observations made recorded in a register.  \\n \\n3.   Each vehicle shall be equipped with an approved set of tools and first aid kit and the Driver shall \\nbe trained in the ir use.  \\n \\n4.   A first aid blanket shall be carried on every truck and the Driver shall be trained to use it as an \\nimprovised stretcher.  \\n \\n5.   When vehicles are jacked up for working underneath, sufficient number of wooden blocks shall \\nbe put below to pro tect men underneath, should the jack fail. Goggles shall be worn to prevent dust \\ngetting into eyes.  \\n20842 Procedure in Traffic Accidents  \\n \\n1.   Accidents which may appear trivial often result in claims for personal injury or damage to \\nproperty. A Driver s hall, therefore, always be courteous and helpful.  \\n \\n2.   Drivers shall not get involved in an argument as to who was responsible for the accident but \\nendeavor to get all the facts in the case.  \\n \\n3. The following instructions shall be observed by Drivers sh ould an accident occur: -  \\n \\n(a) Stop the vehicle and pull over to the kerb if no other vehicle is involved. The vehicle should not \\nbe disturbed should there be a fatal accident, as police may make note of the evidence. Protect the \\nrear and front so as to d ivert the traffic.  \\n \\n(b) If any one is injured, render first aid; send for the Doctor and ambulance, if necessary. Render \\nevery assistance.                 \\n \\n(c) Do not leave the scene of accident without stopping to identify yourself.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    170   \\n \\n \\n  \\n5) Check the pantograph frame for signs of bending or cracks. Check the springs for any cracks  \\n \\n(6) if possible, take the measurement of the pan as per the Fig. 8.02.  \\n(7) Check the br oken or cracked fittings of the pantograph and see whether the cracks are old or \\nfresh.  \\n \\n \\n \\nII.

While instructions are issued separately in  technical manuals of various \\nequipments, salient points in respect of the following major heads are outlined in this chapter.  \\n \\nI Traction sub -stations  \\n \\nII  Transmission lines and 25 kV feeders  \\n \\nIII Protective equipment  \\n \\nIV Switching Stations  \\n \\nV Remot e Control 4quipment  \\n \\nVI Overhead equipment  \\n \\nVII General  \\n \\nThis chapter is devoted to the technical aspects of work which call for attention during inspections, \\ntests and trials before energization.. Chapter X deals with procedures in connection with \\nenergization and commissioning and putting the assets into beneficial use.  \\n \\n20901 Reference to Rules and Statutory Rules  \\n \\nThe safety of travelling public, railway staff and property shall be ensured by strict compliance with \\nthe rules laid down in.  \\n \\n \\ni) Ind ian Electricity Act 1910 (latest revision),  \\n \\nii)Indian Electricity Rules (latest edition),  \\n \\niii)Indian Railway Act (as amended from time to time),  \\n \\niv)General Rules for Indian Railways and associated Subsidiary Rules prescribed by Zonal \\nRailways,  \\n \\nv)Indian Railways\\' Schedule of Dimensions,  \\n \\nvi)The Rules for Opening of a Railway or Section of a Railway for Public Carriage of Passengers, \\n1935 (as amended from time to time),  \\n \\nvii)Bonding and Earthing Code, Code for Earthing for Traction Installations and  Regulations for \\nPower line Crossings,  \\n \\nviii) Relevant IS or IRS specifications and code of practices for various equipment.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [175]  During the preparations for commissioning, the provisions of al l these rules shall be kept in view.  \\n \\nWherever extracts and Appendix etc., of the rules have been included from these rules in the \\nACTM, the figures and contents would automatically get amended with dates of amendments.  \\n \\nMethods/procedures indicated in t he manual are only for guidance and may be modified as per \\nlatest methods/standards prescribed by RDSO/approved by CEE.  \\n \\n20902 Pre -Commissioning Inspections  \\n \\n1 Pre -commissioning inspections and tests cover two distinct parts, viz.   \\n \\na) Detailed inspectio n at the level of the ACE and Senior Subordinates, and  \\n \\nb) General inspection at the level of the Divisional Officers.   \\n \\nThese two inspections are primary Inspections covering all the Installations and are independent of \\nany inspections which may be carri ed out by Administrative officers.  \\n \\n2,   Officers and staff of various sections (Departments) in the Division should associate themselves \\nwith the field work during construction, acquaint themselves with the Installations, satisfy \\nthemselves about high st andards and quality of work and get the defects noticed rectified then and \\nthere, while work is in progress.  \\n \\n3.   The departmental agencies executing the work in the construction organization shall also keep \\nconstant liaison with their counterparts on th e open line, who will be responsible for the \\nmaintenance of assets created by the construction unit.   \\n \\n20903 Defect and Deficiency Lists  \\n \\nWhen the work is declared as having been completed and ready for Inspection, the field officers and \\nSenior subordina tes of the open line, along with their counterparts of the construction unit and \\nrepresentative of contractors, if any, will carry out joint checks. The checks should be thorough and \\ncover every part of the Installation. In making these checks the latest  drawings should only be used \\n(superseded versions can be misleading and should be positively avoided).  \\n \\nAll defects noticed during such joint checks should be rectified before the sections are taken over by \\nthe open line maintenance organization. The defe cts will be categorized in three types and jointly \\nsigned lists be prepared accordingly:  \\n \\nCategory A - Defects concerning vital safety items and serious shortcomings, which must be \\nrectified before even test charge.  \\n \\nCategory B - Defects , not affecting safety though their rectification before cornrnissioning is \\nessential for trouble free working of electric train service.  \\n \\nCategory C – Minor defects, which need not hold up commissioning and can be rectified after \\ncommissioning in a reasonable time.  \\n \\nDuring the preparatory period, these lists should be constantly reviewed jointly and progress of \\nrectification to be done by construction organization be watched.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [176]  \\n \\n  \\n1. TRACTION SUB -STATIONS  \\n20904 Planning of Power Supply  \\n1.   Sub-stations play a vital role in electric traction and, therefore, the need for considerable care \\nduring erection and commissioning cannot be over -emphasized. A high standard of workmanship Is \\nessential and the pre - com missioning tests should be systematically carried out by competent staff, \\nusing dependable and calibrated instruments.  \\n2.   When a long stretch of section of the railway is sanctioned for electrification, detailed planning of \\nsection by section energizing  be undertaken and commissioning for commercial operation of electric \\ntraction over appropriate sections with partial change of traction be decided. Keeping in view the \\nfact that 100% traffic cannot be switched over till a viable section of the Railway is completed, the \\norder in which the sub -stations should be brought on line should be decided by CEE in consultation \\nwith RE and operating branch. This decision should take into account the reliability of supply for the. \\nenergized section, the tariff structur e and the commitments in regard to contract demand and \\nminimum guarantee to supply authorities.  \\n \\n3.   The supply authorities may then be advised the dates by which power supply will be needed at \\nthe various sub -stations. Agreements may be entered into at appropriate time to make sure that the \\nsupply authorities do not delay the work on their part and have adequate time to complete the \\nconstruction of their works for connecting the substation to the grid.  \\n \\n4.    The phasing diagram, deciding which phases o f SEB\\'s transmission lines will be connected at \\ndifferent sub - stations should be finalized in consultation with supply authorities for the entire section \\nof the Zonal Railway planned for electrification, keeping in view power supply on adjacent railway \\nsystems. The connection of the substations to the transmission lines should be in cyclic order so \\nthat the load due to electric traction on the grid system is well balanced and remain within the \\npermissible limits of unbalance.                          \\n \\n5.   The power supply to traction substation is connected through transmission line, which often \\ncross the track. The application for the \\'Track Crossing\\' should therefore be processed well in \\nadvance through Sr. DEE (G), to avoid delays in the supply connecti on.  \\n \\n20905 Commissioning of Traction Transformers  \\nDuring the preparation for commissioning of transformers at traction sub -stations In addition to \\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions, the following steps shall be taken:  \\n \\ni) Drying out of transformer shall be un dertaken as per the procedure laid down. (Refer para 20208)  \\n \\nii) Tap -changing mechanism shall be checked for being in perfect operating condition, both \\nelectrically and mechanically. Ratio test should also be done in this procedure. (Refer para 20206)  \\n \\niii) Transformer bushings should be paid special attention to ensure that the manufacturer seal is \\nintact and the bushings are in excellent condition. The Insulation Resistance of the bushing should \\nbe around 10,000 Meg Ohm.  \\n \\niv) All gaskets should be prop erly compressed and tight fitted. No leakage of oil should be visible \\nfrom valves, pipe joints, gauge glass, radiators or any other parts of transformer. The welded joints \\nshould also be checked for for seepage if any.  \\n \\nV) For a sub -station with more than  one transformer, they should preferably be identical. The \\npolarity on both should be checked.  \\n \\nVi) The oil filled in transformer should be fully de -aerated to avoid false operation of Buchholz relay.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    [177]  vii) The Buchholz relay should be erected as per instructions of the makers and tested for correct \\noperation.  \\nvii) All accessories like silica gel breather vent pipe, explosion vent diaphragm, circulating oil pump \\nand special cooling equipment , if any should be checked.  \\nix) In addition to Buchholz relay, (Refer para 20214) other protective devices provided for the \\nprotection of transformer (Refer para 20212, 20213) should be examined and checked carefully and \\ntested after erection at site.  \\nY.) Earthing of transformers and its neutral terminal shall be done in accordance with the \"Code of \\nPractice for Earthing of Power Supply Installations\" (Appendix 111).  \\n \\n20906 Precautions During Commissioning of Traction Transformer  \\n \\nWhile working on tract ion transformers, the following special precautions should be taken by all the \\nstaff:  \\n \\n1.    It is very important that any one working on a transformer with any of its covers open should \\nremove all loose articles from his clothing such as pens, pencils, wa tches, money, smoking articles, \\ntools particularly if they are oily, as they are liable to slip and fall into the transformer in the course of \\nwork. The number of men working on top should be restricted to the minimum. If tools have to be \\nused they should be fastened by lengths of strings to the workers\\' wrists or to the tank rim.  \\n \\n2.   Moisture lowers the dielectric strength of oil, and hence every possible precaution should be \\ntaken to prevent its entry. Sweat on hands and face should be wiped off freque ntly by a dry cloth \\nand tools should be kept clean and dry, especially when coming in contact with oil. Another source \\nof entry of moisture into the tank is by condensation. If at transformer is at a lower temperature than \\nits surroundings, condense will f orm on the exposed surfaces. Transformer should, therefore, be at \\nor above the ambient temperature before being opened for work at any time.  \\n \\nIf any cleaning or wiping is necessary, this should be done with clean, dry oil using soft, non -fluffy \\ncloth, and  never by using cotton waste.  \\n \\n20907 Tests on Transformer Windings  \\n(i)  Insulation resistance readings should be recorded with a 2500 V or 5000 V megger. The \\nfollowing are the minimum permitted values at an ambient temperature of 30 degree centigrade. \\nTemperature has a  material influence on insulation resistance, and therefore the test should not be \\nconducted when oil is hot.  \\n2000 Mega Ohm between EHV winding and earth.  \\n400 Mega Ohm between 25 kV winding and earth.  \\n2500 Meg Ohm between EHV and 25 kV w indings.  \\n \\nii) Test on insulation: The test consists of applying dc high voltage (2500 V or 5000 M, with the help \\nof a megger, continuously between winding and earth, and noting the insulation resistance at the \\nend of 10 sec, 60 see and 600 sec. To maintai n constant voltage, a motor -driven megger is \\npreferable. The polarization ratios R60/RIO and R600/R60 should not he less than 1.4 and 1.2 \\nrespectively. (RIO, R60, R600 are the Insulation Resistance values after 10 sec, 60 see and 600 \\nsec respectively).  \\niii) Phasing out test : This is comparatively easy, as single phase transformers alone are provided at \\ntraction sub station : if both the transformers install at a sub station are of identical manufacture the \\nterminal connections will be identical. Neverthel ess , the correctness of polarity should be checked \\napplying 400 V across the primaries in an identical manner and measuring the relative voltage \\nbetween the two secondaries of transformers after connecting one terminal of one secondary with \\nthe correspond ing terminal of the other.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1               178  iv) oil test : The tests on transformer oil should be done In accordance with IS -1866 for oil in use \\n(See Annexure 2.03 Chapter 11).  \\n \\n20908 Circuit Break ers and Interruptors  \\nThe installation of circuit breakers and interruptors should be carefully done as per Instruction \\nManual of makers. The following special checks may  be made.  \\n \\nCheek, first of all, if the circuit breaker mounting is quite vertical an d the base firmly secured. \\nExamine the operating mechanism in the weatherproof housing for cleanliness, free movement of \\nrollers, bearings and sliding surfaces, which should be very lightly oiled. Open and close the breaker \\nseveral times to cheek that ever ything is working smoothly. Make sure that all pins, locking plates \\nand split -pins are in place.  \\n \\nOn the electrical side, examine the condition of the wiring, its insulation resistance and tightness of \\nthe terminal screws. Check if the opening and closing  solenoid or motor when electrically operated \\ndoes operate satisfactorily with battery voltage 20 per cent less and 1 0 per cent more than the \\nrated voltage. Check also the manual operation and record the operating time for closing and \\nopening. Examine whe ther the heater in the equipment cabinet is in working order. Observe if the \\nauxiliary contacts are clean and good and the terminal block well secured.  \\n \\nSelect a few circuit breakers at random to inspect the Interior of the arc -extinction chamber to make \\nsure that the main circuit breaker contacts are in excellent condition and their alignment good, but \\ntaking care not to contaminate the parts. The parts handled should be washed thoroughly well with \\ngood transformer oil and put back and oil level restored.   \\n \\nCheck and record the dielectric strength of oil in every circuit breaker, taking out the oil through the \\nsampling cock. If the break -down voltage (BDM is less than 40 kV, oil will have to be dried out. This \\nis easily done by a small portable oil purifie r having, a capacity of 200 liters per hour. After drying -\\nout, repeat the BDV test, taking the precautions described in Chapter 11.  \\n \\nExamine particularly if there is any strain on the circuit breaker porcelain housing because of \\nmisalignment or  rigidity o f the connection from its terminals to the busbars. Usually this is made \\nthrough flexible connectors; nevertheless, it is wise to check the position of the connecting leads \\nwhen the bolts are loosened. Make sure also that the metal -to-metal contact is perf ect at the \\nterminal connections. Any imperfection here will result in overheating of the terminal which may \\neven lead to eventual fracture of the housing itself. It is best to measure the contact resistance by \\n\"Ductor\" or similar low -resistance -reading ins trument.  \\n \\nFinally , cheek the general condition of the equipment, finish and weather -proof -ness of the cabinet \\nand whether it is Insect -proof, whether fuses are intact, and if the operation counter, where \\nprovided, works properly and if the metal supports and frame are well earthed.  \\n \\n20909 Isolators  \\nExamine the insulators carefully for any surface cracks and make sure if the surface is clean. Check \\noperation of isolator manually to see if  the movement is free and smooth, and if the switch blades \\nare fully  open or fully closed when the handle is locked at the top or bottom position. Examine the \\ncontacts and cheek if the spring pressure  is adequate and blades make full contact. Cheek terminal \\nconnections, preferably the a \"Ductor\", Examine whether the interl ocking between the circuit \\nbreaker and its associated Isolator functions properly and the isolator frame is solidly connected to \\nearth by two independent connections. For interlocking scheme for EHV and 25 kV CBs & isolators, \\nreference may be made to RDSO Drawing(ETI/PSI/5212).  \\n \\n20910 Current and Potential Transformers  \\nCheck and record the insulation resistance of primary and secondary to earth and between primary \\nand secondary.Check oil level in PT if it is not of the sealed type as also its dielectric s trength. Top \\nup the oil drawn for test. Make  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [179]  sure that the terminal connections are well made preferably recording the contact resistance of CT \\nconnections by a \"Ductor\". The frames of the PT and CT should be well earthed by two independent \\nconnections to earth.   \\n20911 Lightning Arrestors  \\nMake a thorough visual examination of the outer porcelain housing for hair -line cracks and chipped \\nsheds. Clean the outer surface of all dust. The connec ting leads to the arrestor should be solid and \\ndirect. The earth terminal of the lightning arrester should be connected to the general earthing main \\nat the substation, to the transformer tank body and finally to an independent earth electrode \\nprovided very  close to the arrestor.  \\n \\n20912 Shielding and Earthing  \\nCheek whether the whole of the sub -station area is well protected against atmospheric surges by \\nscreening conductors strung between substation structures and solidly connected to the earth \\nsystem in a ccordance with the approved drawing.  \\n \\nCheck visually whether the metallic casing of every sub -station equipment and the neutral terminals \\nof the power – transformers are solidly connected to the sub -station earthing grid,and confirm that \\nthe \"Code for Ear thing Power  \\nSupply Installations\" Appendix 111 is complied with in all respects.  \\n \\n20913 Busbars and Insulators  \\n \\nA careful inspection should be, made of every insulator supporting a busbar to detect any minute \\ncracks on the surface; paint marks or dust s hould be removed and the surface gloss restored.  \\n \\nTime spent in checking the current carrying joints on busbars and terminal connections will pay \\nample dividends. The contact surface should be clean, smooth and without any irregularities and \\nburrs, so tha t when they are tightened the area of contact is large. The pressure should also be \\nadequate. Particular care should be taken when joints are made between two dissimilar metals like \\naluminium and copper. Special bimetallic fittings should be used in such c ases to prevent \\nelectrolytic corrosion. Connections should be such as to produce no strain on the equipment.  \\n \\n20914 Clearances  \\n \\nThe minimum clearances in mm in air for live equipment shall be as under  \\n \\n25 KV   66kV   100kV    132kV        22OkV  \\n \\n1. Betwe en phases       -                630                  900                  1300              2400  \\n \\n2.

The LT control board should also \\nhave matching capacity. An  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     180 auxiliary transformer of 100 kVA, 1 -phase 25 kV / 240 V is provided to cater to the substation and \\ncontrol load. The station transformer should al so he subjected to detailed inspection and check as \\nfor the main transformer.  \\nThe control room building shall be neat, well ventilated and provided with a strong door. The control \\npanel should have sufficient space all round to provide working space to ca rry out the necessary \\ntests.  \\n \\n20916 Batteries & Battery Charger  \\nThe Battery room should be particularly well ventilated, protected, dust -free and dry. The battery \\nroom floor and walls upto a height of 2 m should be painted with anti -sulphuric acid paint.  The \\nbatteries themselves should be well supported on teakwood stands, painted with anti -sulphuric acid \\npaint and resting on porcelain insulators to prevent leakage. Examine the log book for the period \\nduring which the battery was given its first charge an d make sure that the manufacturer\\'s \\ninstructions have been adhered to as regards the rate of charge and the number of charge and \\ndischarge cycles. Make sure there is no possibility of the battery gases reaching the equipment \\nroom. Observe the condition of the battery plates    \\'take specific gravity of all the cells and voltage \\nacross each cell on load. Check if all the inter -cell connectors are tight and well vaseline. Check \\nfinally if the battery fuses are of the correct capacity and there is no possibili ty of battery supply \\nfailure. Make sure that the alarm bell goes off if the supply is interrupted for any reason to the \\ncontrol panels.  \\n \\nThe battery charger should be inspected to make sure that its capacity,for normal and boost charge \\nas well as trickle charge is sufficient and that it complies with the technical specifications, that the \\nmeters provided are indicating properly and it is complete with necessary fuses and indicating \\nlamps. The metal easing should have two independent earths.  \\n \\n20917 General   \\nInspect the substation area to make sure that it has good drainage, that it has good all -weather road \\nas well as rail access, that the whole area is well fenced -in with lockable gates wide enough to \\npermit entry of a motor truck. Ensure that baffle wall in between traction power transformer and \\nsuitable oil drainage arrangement with an oil soak pit has been made in accordance with IE Rule 64 \\n(2). The numbering of transformers, isolators, circuit breakers, Incoming transmission lines and \\noutgoing 25 kV fee der lines should be checked to see if it has been correctly done, and does \\ncorrespond with the numbering scheme on the control panels at the sub -station control room , and \\nalso on the mimic diagram board at the RCC. Fire extinguishers and fire -buckets fill ed with sand \\nshall be kept ready at hand.

CEE(PSI) of RE organization shall carry out a general inspection of every part \\nof the sub -station along With the Contractors\\' representative. Considering that these are high \\nvoltage instal lations, the inspection should be thorough. As many spot checks as possible should be \\nconducted to ascertain the condition of the equipment and the care taken during erection. Particular \\nattention should be paid to the safety aspects like clearances, opera tion of protective relays and \\nfunctioning of the trip circuits and earthing. The statutory regulations such as the Indian Electricity \\nAct and Rules should be strictly complied with and the inspecting officers shall each personally \\nsatisfy himself by tests and measurements that the installations are fit in every way to be energized \\nand then issue a joint certificate to that effect.  \\n \\nAn application should thereafter be submitted to the CEE and the Electrical Inspector to the Railway \\nseeking his permission, f or the commissioning of the sub -station, provided power supply will be \\nmade available by the supply authority and testing of protective relays has been completed. After \\nhis sanction is received and the precautions and procedures detailed in Chapter X are c omplied with \\nthe substation may be commissioned.  \\nFor the first three days after commissioning, the substation equipment shall be kept under careful \\nobservation by a senior and experienced supervisory official. Thereafter daily inspection should be \\ncontinu ed for the first fortnight.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    (181)   \\nImmediately after energization the correct operation of every protective relay shall be checked.

On the ba sis of their personal \\nobservations, a joint certificate will be issued by the inspecting officers and contractors\\' \\nrepresentative, confirming that the installation is fit in every respect   for energization  \\nWide publicity should be given to warn the publi c that the lines will be energized and of the \\naccompanying danger to any trespassers. After getting sanctioned of the CEE and Electrical \\nInspector to the Railway, and clearance certificate from all concerned in a manner similar to the \\nprocedure for energiz ing OHE described in chapter X, the transmission line may be energized \\nprovided the sub -station and the connected protective gear have already been tested and \\ncommissioned          \\n20928 25 kV Feeders  \\n Detailed and general inspection of 25 kV feeder lines  should be carried out on the same lines as \\ndescribed for the transmission lines and the OHE. Here too, each tower is individually earthed by a \\nseparate electrode, in addition to being connected together through the overhead earthing \\nconductor. The, cleara nces to, road and rail crossings should be checked with respect to approved \\nplans, duplicate insulators being provided in each  case. No earthed structure, other than the earthed \\nsupporting structure of the 25 kV feeder lines shall  be nearest than 2 m from  the live OHE.  \\nTower footing resistance, insulation resistance of both phase and return conductors and through \\ncontinuity should all be checked and recorded. If the substation is already energized, the 25 kV \\nfeeder; lines can also be energized on lines si milar to procedure described for the transmission lines \\nand the OHE after taking all precautions for safety of equipment and staff working on contiguous \\nsections.  \\n111. PROTECTIVE EQUIPMIENT  \\n20929 Testing of Protective Relays  \\nBefore any traction installat ion is commissioned, the proper operating of every protective - relay \\nshould be ensured so that it can be fully dependent upon in all circumstances. This is done in three \\nstages –  \\n-Checking the relay in the laboratory prior to installation.  \\n-Checking after  installation and before the substation is commissioned.  \\n-Confirmatory test after energization and before introduction of commercial services.  \\nIn carrying out the tests, the Manufacturers\\' instruction manuals should be studied. The \\ncommissioning engineer  should be well acquainted with the principles of operation, constructional \\nfeatures and the traction load conditions,  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1     184  \\n so that the relays may be correctly set.  \\n \\n20930 inspection of Setting of Relays and Calibration of Meters  \\n \\nProtective relays are usually received well packed in separate cases. -After opening the case, the \\nrelay should be - carefully removed, examined for any external damage and taken into the Relay \\nTesting Laboratory. Befor e removing the cover, remove all traces of dust from the case and the \\ncover. Check the name -plate particulars to see if they are correct. Check carefully the delicate relay \\nmovement and make sure if it is  quite free mechanically, and all parts are clean an d connections \\ntight, taking care not to disturb the settings. See whether the flag operating and reset mechanism is \\nfunctioning well. Examine the cleanliness and wipe of contacts.  \\n \\nThe performance of the relay for different settings should then be checked using standard relay \\ntesting equipment, making such adjustments as may be found necessary. A detailed record of the \\ntest set up and the calibration curves should be entered in a register as a permanent record. The \\nplug settings are then correctly made to c ater for the expected load conditions.  1   \\nWhere relays have both current and potential coils, as in directional and MHO relays particular \\ncheck should be made to see whether the internal connections of the two sets of coils are correct. If \\nthe polarity o f one with respect to the other is not right, the relay will fail to operate on a fault, which \\nshould, of course, never be permitted to occur.  \\n \\nIf everything is alright, the relay cover may he put back, after checking the interior once again and \\nwiping al l dust on the cover. It is recommended that the date of calibration should be painted on the \\ncase for ready reference. A test certificate should be issued to the field officer for record.  \\n \\nSimultaneously, maximum demand and energy meters should also he go t calibrated and sealed in \\nconsultation with the Supply Authority.  \\n \\n20931 Protective Devices at Sub -stations  \\n \\nThe following protective and indicating devices are provided for each traction transformer :  \\n \\n1.Differential protection  \\n2.Restricted earth fau lt protection on EHV and 25 kV sides.  \\n3.Buchholz relay with alarm and trip contacts.  \\n4. Winding temperature protection with alarm and trip contacts.  \\n5.Oil  temperature protection with alarm and trip contacts.  \\n6. Protection against low oil level.  \\n \\nIn ad dition, a low oil level indicator is provided on the conservator tank. Local Indicators are \\nprovided on the transformer tank for excessive oil and winding temperatures, whereas a common \\nindication only is provided on the control panel at the RCC for excess ive winding and oil \\ntemperatures as well as Buchholz relay.  \\n \\nThe following further protective relays are provided for each feeder circuit breakers :  \\n1. Over -current relay for faults close to the substation  \\n2.  MHO relay for distance protection.  \\n3.   MHO relay for wrong coupling between two substations.  \\n \\nProper functioning of each of these relays and the contact mechanism of each should be checked \\nindividually.At the same time, the correct operation of the following annunciations and the \\nassociated cancelling b uttons and flag indications should also be checked :  \\n \\n1.EHV transformer circuit breaker auto -trip. \\n2.

Test plugs where provided for checking relay operation should be \\nexamined  if they fit properly. Indicating lamps should be functioning properly, but a switch should be \\nprovided to cut them out when the station is unattended.  \\nCheck should also be made for proper functioning of device provided for tripping CBs in the event of \\n110 V dc supply failure.  \\n20932 Control Circuits and Wiring  \\nAfter installation of all equipment and completion of control cable connections, a detailed check of \\nthe wiring should be conducted. verifying the colour, code and identification tags and markings on \\nthe terminal strips on the equipment and the control panels  with respect to the approved wiring \\ndiagram. Insulation and continuity tests should also be taken and values recorded.  \\n \\nA word of caution is necessary here. The detailed diagrams of control c ircuit and wiring, of control \\npanel supplied by the Manufacturers should not merely be taken on trust, but subjected to careful \\nscrutiny  as to their correctness. Errors do occur in drawings  and if they are not  detected at the very \\nearly stage Itself, they  may cause a great deal of confusion and trouble later. The best method of \\ndetecting errors in detailed wiring diagram is  to prepare a simplified schematic or functional diagram \\nso that the circuit arrangements becomes quite clear and obvious. It will then  be known what exactly \\nto do for any test, what links to close or open and what connections to make or break. To restore the  \\nconnections back to normal after the tests have been successfully completed, a detailed diary \\nshould be kept of every change or alt eration made for purpose of test. If any modifications are \\nrequired to correct the errors discovered, the Manufacturer should be advised immediately and his \\nconfirmation obtained. When the work is completed, overall operation may be checked by manually \\nclosing the relay contacts and finding out whether the appropriate device has operated or not..  \\n20933 Fuses  \\nControl circuit fuses shall be -of correct rating. If the -trip battery circuit fuse is under -rated, it is liable \\nto deteriorate due to excessive heatin g and fail ultimately, which could indeed be dangerous. To \\nguard against this possibility, alarms are sometimes provided to draw the attention of the operator in \\nthe event of fuse failure. In ac traction, failure of battery fuse is automatically relayed to  the RCC but \\nthe TPC cannot replace the fuse by RC, someone has to go and replace it which may take \\nconsiderable time. In view of this, fuses in the control circuit may err by being slightly over -sized. but \\nshould never be under -sized. For the same reason all connections in the trip circuit should be well \\nmade and the fixing screws kept tight, but not over -tight which may cause excessive pinching of the \\nconnecting lead and may eventually cause  a breakage.  \\n20934 Insulation and Lead Burden Measurement  \\n Insulation resistance to earth should be measured. Any connection to earth and wiring made \\ndeliberately  such as   \\nearthing  links on current and voltage transformers and on dc supply should be removed before the \\ntest; care being  \\n INDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTIO N MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1     186   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n‘A\\' should be a moving coil centre –zero type low range ammeter . A 6 V storage battery may be used to \\nenergized the primary winding through a single pole push -button  switch. On closing the push button, the dc \\nammeter should show a positive flick, and on opening a negative flick.  \\n20936 Primary Injection Test  \\nThis check is carried out with a “ primary injection set” , which is usually arrange for connection to the 240 V \\nsupply means and furnishes heavy current at a low voltage. Provision usually exists to connect the secondary \\nwindings of the test set either in series or in parallel to get the necessary output. A 10 KVA test set usually \\npermits currents up to 1000 A to be obtained with four secondary windings in pa rallel and upto 250 A at a \\nhigher voltage with the windings in series. When dealing with very large currents, it is essential that the \\nconnecting leads and area of contact and contact pressure should be adequate enough: otherwise, higher \\nvalues of current will not flow.  \\nThe merit of primary injection test is that it gives an overall check on the correctness of  the entire circuitry.  \\n20937 Voltage Transformer Ratio and Polarity Check  \\nPolarity of the potential transformer could also be checked using the same  method described for current \\ntransformer testing. In this case, however, care should be taken to connect the battery supply to the primary \\nwinding with the moving coil ammeter connected to the secondary winding.  \\nThe ratio check can be may when the 25 KV busbars are first made alive. The PT secondary voltage is then \\ncompared with that of another PT known to have the correct ratio, after connecting it to the primary bars.  \\n20938 Electrical Operation of Indicators and Associated Devices  \\nAll shunt connected in dicator, annunciators, internal auxiliary elements, DC auxiliary and master trip relays, \\nshould be checked for operation at the minimum voltage stipulated by the Manufacturer. Series -operated \\nindicators or auxiliary relays should be checked at their pick -up values. Confirm that auxiliary relays reset \\nwhen voltage and current supply is removed after operation.  \\n20939 Secondary Injection Test  \\nThese tests are done with a secondary injection test set. Normally, operating times and minimum closing \\nvalues are chec ked for induction relays. For instantaneous attracted armature type relays, the minimum \\nclosing and resetting values are checked. For directional relays, directional characteristics are checked.  \\n20940 Alarm and Trip Check  \\nEnsure that all fuses, links, trip  latches etc. are in normal position. By operating each relays manually, verified \\nif the appropriate circuit breaker trips. Inter -tripping of primary and secondary circuit breakers should also be \\nchecked. There should be no normal -operation of any other ci rcuit. In every case of tripping, the appropriate \\nflag indication should take place on annunciator, accompanied by operation of the alarm.  \\n20941 Load Test  \\nAfter the section is commissioned, a final check  should be made of the proper operation of all volt meters \\nammeteres and relays when normal load currents are flowing through the circuits. For differential circuits, spill \\ncurrents should be measured to prove that protection will be stable under external faults, by shorting the \\nsecondary terminal on one, c urrent,transformer : operation under an internal fault should also be checked The \\ndirectional features of directional relays should also, be checked This ensures that the,relative polarity of CT \\nand PT is correct.  \\n20942 Confirmatory test of OHE Protective  Relays  \\n A short time after OHE has been successfully charged at 25 kV, it is de -energized to conduct final \\nconfirmatory test on the operation of OHE protective relays. Although relays would necessarily have been \\ntested on the test  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TR ACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1      188 bench at the laboratory and subsequently in the field after erection, a final confirmatory field test is essential \\nbefore declaring the section as fit for commercial operation to ensure that in the event of a fault  the relays do \\ntrip.  \\n \\n2.    The over current and MHO relays should all be set for instantaneous operation as mentioned earlier. In \\nall, the following three tests are necessary and in each case all the feeder circuit breakers and their \\nassociated relays sh ould be tested one after another :  \\na) A direct fault on the busbars of the feeding post to test operation of the over -current relays.  \\nb) A fault at the farthest end of a single line section under emergency feed conditions to check the operation \\nof the MH O relay and also the under -voltage relay at the sectioning post.  \\nC) Closing the bridging interruptor at sectioning post to check the operation of wrong phase coupling relay.  \\n \\n3.    Test (a) can be conducted as soon as the substation and feeding posts are  commissioned, without \\nwaiting for the energization of the OHE. In carrying out Tests (b) and (c) one must provide and be prepared for \\nthe very remote contingency of the MHO relay failing to trip the circuit breaker when It is closed on the fault, \\ndue to p olarity of the potential coil of the MHO relay not being correct in relation to that of the current coil. \\nBefore starting the test, trip circuit operation should be checked by manual closing of the relay contacts. A \\nresponsible official should remove the M HO relay cover and be ready to close the relay contacts manually and \\ntrip the circuit breaker, should it fall to do so automatically when the circuit breaker Is closed on the fault. \\nShould this happen, the connecting leads either of the potential coil or t he current coil on the MHO relay \\nshould be reversed and the test repeated.  \\n \\n4.    For carrying out the short circuit tests, care should be taken to earth the line by a solid flexible, jumper \\nconnection (105 mm to an earthed structure. A thin wire such as 14 SWG should never be used for \\nconnection to earth, under the mistaken impression that the fuse would blow out and not jeopardize system \\nstability, should the 25 kV circuit breaker fail to trip. It should be remembered that the circuit breaker is \\ndesigned  to clear the fault whereas the improvised fuse is not. When it blows on account of heavy short circuit \\ncurrent, the flash over caused by it can damage the galvanizing of the mast and perhaps shatter any insulator \\nnearby.  \\n \\n5.    A point to be - ensured in particular is that none of the relays at the grid substation trips during any of \\nthese short circuit tests. This can be ensured earlier by proper co -ordination of relay settings at the traction \\nsub-station. Normally, the traction circuit breaker trips out within about 250 milli -seconds from the occurrence \\nof short circuit. The Supply Authorities should be requested to set their relays allowing a time lag of 0.5 \\nseconds to ensure that the substation circuit breaker dots not trip for faults on the railway tra ction system.  \\n \\n6.    It is quite possible that in these short circuit tests, more than one relay associated with the feeder circuit \\nbreaker may operate; for example, the MHO relay In addition to the over -current relay, even for a fault close to \\nthe sub - station. This is quite in order, since this automatically gives back up protection. A note should be \\nmade as to which flag indications have operated to ascertain which of the protective relays have operated \\nduring each test.  \\n \\n7.   When testing the wrong ph ase coupling relay, it may sometimes happen that the relay at one substation \\nalone may operate and not at both ends, as may be expected. This is possible if the operating times of the \\ntwo relays differ even slightly. This, however, does not matter at all. Nevertheless if it is required to check the \\nother relay, the relay which has operated may be blocked and the performance of the other relay tested by a \\nsecond test.  \\n \\n8.   The operation of the under -voltage relay at the sectioning post for a fault at the f arthest end under \\nemergency feed conditions can be checked by posting someone at the sectioning post. The test could \\nhowever be postponed by a few days and conducted after introduction of commercial services.  \\n \\n9.    Since these confirmatory tests are to b e conducted after successful energization of the OHE and before \\nintroduction of commercial operation, It is essential to complete the tests in the shortest possible time. \\nHowever, being the most severe tests these should not be repeated too often. This can  be ensured by \\norganizing the work properly by posting testing parties at the right places and controlling all operations \\nthrough the TPC and by RC.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1     [189]  IV. SWITCHING STATIONS AND BOOSTER TRA NSFORMER STATIONS  \\n20943 Power Supply  \\nPower supply for all switching stations is arranged through the 10 KVA,25 Kv/240V auxiliary \\ntransformers connected to UP and DN line in double line section. If an ac 240 V supply near by is \\navailable from the supply aut hority, a service connection should be taken from the source as well.  \\nA 24 hour record of voltage should be taken and the tap switch of the auxiliary transformers \\ncorrectly set.  \\n \\n20944 Installation of  Equipment  \\nThe installation of every item of equipment  like interruptors, isolators, busbars, lightning arresters \\nand wiring from equipment to the control panel in the switching stations cubicle, 72/110 V and 24 V \\nbatteries and ,battery chargers etc. .should be,checked, keeping the points referred to in paras  \\n20915 to 20918 in mind, except for the following minor variations.  \\n1. Intterruptors are installed for controlling supplies to the sub -sectors. The remarks made \\nunder para 20908 are equally applicable, except that no relays are associated with them.  \\n2. Potenti al transformers for catenary supply indication are mounted on the switching station \\ngantry.  \\n3. 25 kV lightning  arrestors are also installed on the gantry.  \\n20945 Clearances  \\nCheck whether the following minimum clearances for 25 kV do exist:  \\n1. Height of any li ve conductors from ground level     3m \\n2. Distance between any live part(25kV) and      500m  \\n earthed part or part likely to be earthed  \\n(In special circumstances and with the approval of the design office this can be 450mm.)  \\n3. Between any live part (3kV) an d earthed part     150mm  \\n such as return conductor or return feeder  \\nNo live part may project beyond the fenced  enclosure except at a height of 6.1m or more. This \\nshould be particularly checked to guard against the possibility of danger to any member of the  public \\nwho may walk by the side of the switching station with an umbrella or a long pole.  \\nCheck and ensure that the distance from the centre of the nearest track to the face of the switching \\nstation gantry is not less than 3.5 m.  \\n20946 Auxiliary Transfo rmers & Booster Transformers  \\nThese should be inspected and tested in accordance with the procedure earlier stipulated under \\n“substation” –part I above.  \\n \\nThe mounting of these transformers should be checked to ensure proper fitment and conformity with \\nsche dule of dimensions and electrical clearances.  \\nThe booster installations, in particular should be checked for correct jumper connections.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTIOP4 MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART [190]  20947 General  \\n \\nVerify whether the erection of fencing i s neat and all parts are given a good finish with paint, the \\ngate is provided with a good lock and anti -climbing devices are satisfactory. The area inside the \\nswitching station should be leveled at least 10 cm above the surrounding area. Good drainage must  \\nbe provided so that there may be no possibility of water logging at any time.  \\n \\nTo facilitate unloading and loading of heavy materials transported by trolley or OHE inspection car, \\na suitable loading platform should be provided from which a path -way shoul d be available upto, the \\ngate. Wherever possible a jeepable road approach should also be provided from the nearest public \\nroad.  \\n \\nWhen the switching station is at the foot of or at the top of a steep embankment, suitable foot steps \\nshould be provided leadi ng upto the gate.  \\n \\n20948 Interlocking  \\n \\nVerify whether the double -pole isolator associated with every interruptor is equipped with an \\ninterlock and it is functioning properly. It should not be possible to open or close the isolator unless \\nthe interruptor is locked in the open position. It should also not be possible to operate the interruptor \\neither manually or by RC, unless the isolator is locked in the open or closed position. To ensure this, \\nthe interlocking device should consist of a lock combined with  an electrical contactor on the \\noperating mechanism of the interruptor to make or break the RC circuit and a lock for the isolator \\noperating mechanism, with a common captive interlock key for the two locks.  \\n \\n20949 Feeding Posts  \\n \\nAt locations where the tr action substation is close to the tracks, the feeding post may be a part of \\nthe substation; if, however, it is far away, the feeding post close to the tracks will receive 25 kV \\nsupply from the traction substation, with 25 kV feeder circuit breakers located  at the substation end.  \\n \\nIn either case, the neutral conductor (also called the negative or return conductor) of the feeder line \\nshould be solidly connected to the track rails, In addition to being earthed at the traction transformer \\nend. This connection to the rails is vitally important for the proper and safe working of the traction \\nsystem and it should under no circumstances be broken. To ensure this, the neutral conductor is \\nconnected to the rails by eight independent galvanized steel stranded (7/16) c ables for a double \\ntrack section with two conductors for each rail. The ends of stranded cables are brazed or welded \\non to suitable shoes which are riveted to the rail webs.  \\n \\nExamine all the connections and make sure that the cables are well bonded to the  rails with \\nsufficient length left free for flexibility. The down -lead from the terminal tower should be well \\nprotected mechanically to prevent its being cut and stolen.  \\n \\n20950 Number Plates and Boards  \\n \\nCheck the numbering of the interruptors, isolators,  PTs and then jumper connections to the OHE to \\nsee if they do correspond to the numbering scheme on the control panel in the switching station \\nequipment room, the mimic diagram board at the RCC and the sub -sector numbers.  \\n \\nCheck also if the following boar ds and fittings are provided at each switching station :  \\n \\n1 Switching station name board,  \\n2.\"Danger boards\" to caution public,  \\n3. \"Protected place\" board prohibiting unauthorized entry,  \\n \\n4. Fire -buckets and fire extinguisher inside the equipment room.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    [191]  \\n  5. First aid box and “Rules for Resuscitation from Electric Shock” board inside the equipment \\nroom.  \\nEssential caution boards and number plates should be painted with fluorescent paint so as  to be \\nbrightly visible in light at night.  \\n \\n20951 Earthing and Bonding  \\nThe structural steel work as well as the neutral conductor of auxiliary transformer, and the metal \\ncase of every electrical equipment shall be connected by two independent connection to  earth in \\naccordance with the “ Code for Earthing Traction Power Supply Installation” vide Appendix III. \\nAccording to this code, HT and LT earths should be provided separately, but interconnected \\ntogether by a link. It is equally important to check that th e structure supporting the busbars are \\nsolidly connected by two independent connections to the none - track circuited rail with single rail \\ntrack circuit or to the mid point of the impedance bonds where both rails are used for track circuiting.  \\n \\nDuring deta iled inspection, the resistance of each electrode should be measured and recorded by a \\nmegger earth tester so that the combined resistance of the HT earthing system is 2 Ohm, or less \\nand of the LT earth 10 Ohm or less, when not connected to the rails.  \\n \\nV. REMOTE CONTROL EQUIPMENT  \\n20952 Importance of Remote Control  \\nRemote Control Center is the nerve center of the traction system, from where full control over every \\nswitching operation on the entire electrified route is exercised, its efficient operation is, therefore, of \\nprime importance for successful working of the system. It is desirable to complete all tests and trials \\non the RC equipment at the RCC and at the switching stations and to make them fully functional \\nbefore energization of OHE. To achieve this , tests and trials should start about a month earlier, by \\nwhich time the following item of work should be ready.  \\n \\n1. Derivative cables from the main telecommunication trunk cable should be led and terminated \\ninside the equipment room in RCC, substations and e ach of the switching stations. Care should be \\ntaken to ensure that the metal sheathing of the derivative cable is terminated short of the cable \\nterminating box and kept insulated from earth inside the equipment room and surge arrestors are \\nprovided for eac h terminal.  \\n2. Repeater stations should be fully functioning.  \\n3. All control phones in RCC and TPC telephones in sub -stations and switching stations be \\ninstalled and commissioned.  \\n4. The air conditioning of the RCC should be complete before the erection of the RC e quipment \\nstarts.  \\n5. RC equipment should be ready and wired up at RCC control led posts.  \\n6. Batteries and battery charger along with power supply and charging arrangements should be \\nready.  \\n20953 Manning of Substations and switching posts  \\nWhen RC equipment is firs t brought into operation, it will take about 6 months before teething \\ntroubles are overcome and equipment stabilizes for trouble free service. During this time, it is \\nnecessary to man the substations and switching stations to operate the interruptors manua lly and \\ngive reports to TPC when required. This situation also arises for longer period if the RCC is not \\nready before energization.  \\nThe switching station attendants should be given adequate training in their duties and should \\nnormally be available from ab out a month before the date of commissioning. It is usually possible to \\nintroduce commercial service on limited scale, before commissioning of RC equipment.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [192]  20954 Level Measurements  \\n Signal l evels should be measured and recorded both at the sending and receiving ends at the \\ncontrol center as well as at every substation and switching station. These measurements are of two \\nkinds:  \\n \\n1.   Individual levels of every frequency on the \\'send\\' channel.  These are measured by a vacuum -\\ntube voltmeter (VTVM) /Transistorized voltmeter (TVM with its selector switch in \"high\" Impedance \\nposition at the oscillator output terminals. These should be about - 16 dB.  \\n2.   On the receive side, the levels are taken wi th VTVM in the \"high\" - impedance position, at the \\ndetector Input terminals: this should be between -17 and - 25 dBm.                              1  \\n3.   Composite levels taken between the terminals of the tele -command and tele -signal cable pairs \\nwith a VT VM with selector,switch in the \"high\" impedance position. Readings may also be taken at \\nthe input and output terminals of the repeater station and plotted. on a graph sheet.  \\n4.   Measurements should be taken of the levels of every channel on send and rece ive pairs at the \\ncontrol centre using the Selective Level Meter. The levels for the send -channels should not be lower \\nthan - 22 dBm. and for the receive channels - 22 to - 30 dBm.  \\n5.   After final adjustment of the levels, a note should be made of the val ues of the attenuation pads \\nincluded in all the circuits and kept as a permanent record for purposes of comparison and \\nreference.  \\n \\nIt may be noted that the line impedance of the send and receive circuits is 1120 Ohm whereas that \\nof the amplifier output on ly 150 Ohm. A matching transformer is therefore provided between the two. \\nWhen measurements are taken, care is required to keep the selector switch of the VTVM in the \\n\"high\" position, as long as the circuits are through, but if the output level is to be me asured with the \\nline or equipment disconnected the switch shall be kept at the 150 Ohm or 1120 Ohm position as \\nnecessary to achieve matching.  \\n \\nAnother point to be kept in mind is that although the individual level of a single channel is say -22 \\ndBm, the l evel indicated on the line is much higher if measured with VTVM because of the presence \\nof a large number of frequencies each of which has a level of - 22 dBm. Thus the correct reading of \\n- 22 dBm is indicated when a Selective Level Meter is used with freq uency range switch in the \\n\"frequency\" position; but the same meter would indicate perhaps + 5 dBm if there are say 12 \\nchannels and the frequency range switch is kept In the \"flat\" position. Distinction should therefore be \\nmade between the individual channe l levels and composite level, where all  \\nfrequencies are present.  \\n \\n20955 Detailed Inspection of RC Equipment  \\nDetailed program of erection of equipment, sequence of preliminary tests to be carried out at the \\nRCC and controlled stations, shall be furnished  by the contractor to enable the Railway staff to carry \\nout stage Inspections and testing of individual panels, equipment cabinets and control units at the \\nmaster station and Remote Terminal units.  \\n \\nWhen contractor reports completion of erection, commissi oning and all adjustments and testing \\nwork and notifies that the installations are ready, detailed inspection shall be carried out by  AEE \\n(TRD) and open line staff along with their counterparts on construction organization and \\nrepresentative of the contrac tor. The defects noticed shall be rectified immediately.  \\n Contractor shall also furnish a detailed test program for the final testing of the RC equipment for the \\napproval of the Railway Engineers. These tests will he done jointly by open line officers, RE officers \\nand the contractors\\' representative. The test program shall cover the proving tests for all the \\nparameters and facilities provided for the operation of RC equipment In the specification. The tests \\nat site after Installation and commissioning shall  constitute the acceptance tests, which will be \\ncarried out after the detailed Inspection and rectification of defects is completed. Thorough checking \\nof all switching operations, correct operation of all alarm, Indications and annunciation facilities, tel e-\\nsignallng and tele -metering arrangements, mimic diagram displays, VDU displays,  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [193]  \\n  data –logging and data storage, diagnostic facilities etc. shall  be done from both control stands of \\nthe master station as well as from the remote terminal units. Operating time for various operation \\nshall also be checked and recorded.  \\n \\nAll these tests carried out jointly shall be recorded so as to establish, authentic initial record of the \\nperformance of the  equipment to ensure that the RC equipment is complete and trouble free.  \\n \\n20956 Interlocking of the Bridging Interruptor  \\nInterlocks in the RC equipment for the bridging interruptor at the sectioning post provide for the \\nfollowing:  \\n \\n1. When catenary supply is available on both sides of the interruptor, the interruptor should not \\nclose.  \\n2. When supply is available only on one side, the interruptor can be closed.  \\n3. When supply is not available on both sides of the interruptor the interruptor can be closed \\nbut should t rip immediately  \\n \\nThis is achieved by utilizing 100 or 110 V ac supply from potential transformers provided for this \\npurpose at the sectioning post.  \\nProvision is also made for the bridging interruptor to trip if the catenary voltage drops too low. This \\nsectioning is adjustable between 15kV and 19kV and should be set at 19kV.  \\nThe above interlocks should be throughly checked when commissioning RC equipment at \\nsectioning posts.  \\n \\n20957 General Inspection by Divisional Officers  \\nAfter defects noticed during the de tailed inspection as above have been rectified, the \\nSr.DEE/DEE(TrD) of the open line together with the counterpart on the construction organization \\nand Contractors representative’s shall carry out general inspection of the entire installation to make \\nsure that it is in good working condition. During the inspection verification of as many tele -command \\nand tele -signals operations as possible shall be carried out from the control centre. Inspection of the \\ninstallation at every sub -station as many posts as poss ible shall also be carried out. Level and \\nfrequency measurements should be taken at random at a few points to compare the result obtain \\nwith those recorded during the detailed inspection.  \\n \\nThe divisional officers will issue a joint certificate if they are fully satisfied with their observations and \\ntests, that the RC installations are fully fit for commissioning. Thereaftaer, the RC may be put into \\nregular services and its operation closely watched by manning the switching stations and sub -\\nstations as menti oned earlier. Detailed record of every failure shall be maintained by TPC and the \\nmaintenance official. Each of these failure should be gone into fully to ascertain the cause of failure, \\nwhich incidentally would give the staff excellent opportunity to get familiar with the circuitry and fault - \\nfind in a procedure.  \\n \\nVI. OVERHEAD EQUIPMENT  \\n20958 Detailed Joint Inspection of OHE  \\nThe importance of OHE arises from the fact that it is extensive, with a very large number of \\ninsulators, fittings and component parts , failure of any one of which may result in dislocation of \\ntraction services for appreciable periods untill the defect is rectified. The adjustment work is \\nparticularly important at cross -over and over -lap spans since any wide departures from the \\nstandards  laid down could cause entanglement of the pantograph with the OHE, with serious \\nrepercussions. The need for a very thorough detailed inspection of every part of the installation, post \\nby post, can not, therefore, be over -stragged.  \\n \\nWhen the OHE contractor  reports completion of all adjustment work, detailed inspection will be \\ncarried out by the AEE(TrD) and staff of the open line with their counterparts on the construction \\norganization and  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    [194]   \\nrepresentatives of the Contractor, using on OHE inspection car, flat -topped wagon of wiring train, or \\nladders as may be convenient.  \\n \\n20959 Compliance with Latest   \\n \\nThe OHE shall be strictly in compliance with the latest approved General Supply Diagram, \\nSecti oning Diagram, Layout Plan and Structure Erection, particularly in regard to  \\n \\n1. run of conductors; stagger and height;  \\n \\n2. disposition of brackets and clearances;  \\n \\n3. correctness of jumper connections, especially at switching and booster transformer st ations;  \\n \\n4. numbering of interruptors, circuit breakers and isolators in relation to the elementary sections, \\nsub- sectors or sectors controlled.  \\n \\n20960 Infringements  \\n \\nNone of the wayside or over -line structures shall cause infringement of the Schedule of Dimensions. \\nEvery such infringement shall be individually recorded and action taken immediately either to have \\nthem removed or, where this Is not possible, to obtain sanction from the Commissioner of Railway \\nSafety.  \\n \\n20961 Important Point to he Checked   \\n \\nThe following points shall be checked during the detailed inspection:  \\n \\n1.    Cantilever Assemblies : Every cantilever assembly shall be adjusted strictly in accordance with \\nthe approved structure erection , especially in regard to the positioning of sta y arm, bracket tube \\nand register arm. The projection of bracket tube and register arm and the allowance in the stay arm \\nshall be sufficient for slewing of tracks. Normally this allowance is 15 cm to 20 cm from the centre \\nline of catenary suspension bracket  to end of bracket tube and 20 cm (min.) for register arms. All \\nnuts should be tightened and locking plates provided with split pins or check nuts. Make sure that all \\ntemporary earths provided by Contractor\\'s men during  construction work have been removed.   \\n \\n2.    Anchoring Points: The movement of counter -weights shall be free and not obstructed in any \\nway. Flexible steel ropes shall move freely and centrally with respect to the pulley sheaves and not \\nrub against any member. The distance between the pulley centres and the height of counterweight \\nabove the muff level, shall be as per the chart in relation to the prevailing ambient temperature. Anti -\\ncreeps shall be properly tensioned and positioned.  \\n \\n3.    Overlap Spans.. Adjustments at insulated and uninsula ted overlap spans, turn -outs, crossovers \\nand section insulator assembly shall be correct not only in respect of the run of conductors and \\njumper connections, but also the height of contact wire. The separation between different OHE and \\ndisplacement of cant ilevers at insulated overlaps should be adequate.  \\n \\n4.    Insulators : Insulators shall be perfectly clean. Should the surface be polluted by dust, it should \\nbe cleaned and gloss restored. All. insulators on out -of-run wires should be so located that they do \\nnot foul but are well away from the zone swept by the pantographs: The runners of section \\ninsulators should be so located as to be beyond the zone of sweep of pantographs running on \\nadjacent tracks. There should be no undue sag due to the section insula tors, the runners should be \\nlevel and not be tilted to one side so that the pantograph may pass smoothly.  \\n \\n5.   Height of Contact Wire: This shall be checked at every structure and at mid -span for regulated \\nOHE. A pre - determined sag in the contact wire o f 50 mm or 100 mm at mid -span on a 72 m span for 50 or 100 mm presag compensated OHE respectively should exist on the open routes. Height of \\ncontact wire at level crossings shall not be less than 5.50 m.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1 195   \\n6. Stagger : Stagger in tangent track shall be to the left and to the right of the alternatively, not \\nexceeding 200 mm on either side of the centre line of the track, except where otherwise specified in Structure \\nErection Drawings.  Stagger for i n-running OHE shall not be more than 300 mm at the mast/structure on the \\noutside of curves except in case of overlap spans and also at the turn -outs.  Stagger of contact wire at mid -\\nspan in transition portion of the curves shall be within 200 mm.  \\n \\n7. Gradient  of Contact Wire :  On both side of overline structures, tunnels and level crossings, the \\ngradient of contact wire shall be in accordance with the approved profile.  \\n \\n8. Clearances: The live metallic caps of insulators on out of run wires shall be at atleast 2  m away from \\nadjacent earthed mast/structure (other than the OHE structure).  The distance of these insulators shall be 3 m \\nfrom the bracket supporting the OHE in case of insulated overlaps.  Clearance of 2 m shall normally exist from \\nnearest point of two adjacent elementary sections except at the section insulators.  Where clearance of 2 m is \\nnot available.  It shall be not less than the minimum long duration electric clearance of 320 mm.  Whenever \\nthe OHEs of two elementary sections cross one another, nec essary cut in insulators shall be provided.  \\n \\n9. Bonding : Every mast/structure supporting OHE as well as platform structures, foot over bridges etc. \\nshall be properly bonded to the rails and earthed in accordance with the Bonding and Earthing code ( \\nAppendix II)  \\n \\n10. Return Conductors of Booster Transformer Installations:  The return conductor connection both at the \\nOHE and the rail should be checked from the point of view of good electrical contact and security from \\nmechanical damage.  \\n \\n11. Telephone or Power Crossin gs : Keep a close watch for any overhead telephone crossings over the \\nOHE, which may not have been removed by oversight.  Immediate steps should be taken to have these \\nremoved.  High voltage transmission line crossings across the tracks shall be checked ag ainst the approved \\nplan authorizing the crossing, particularly the clearance between the OHE and the guard wires, duly recording \\nthe results individually.  If the crossing is not in accordance with the approved plan, the Supply Authority \\nshould be contacte d immediately and the infringements should either be removed or necessary relaxation be \\nobtained from CEE and Electrical Inspector to the Railway.  \\n \\n20962 Notices to be Displayed – Caution Boards and Number Plates  \\nDuring the detailed inspection, special att ention shall be paid to verify whether the following notices have \\nactually been displayed at the various locations indicated below: - \\n \\n1.  ‘Treatment for electric shock’ boards, giving instructions for treatment of electric shock in English and the \\nregional  language, at all railway stations (ASMs or SMs Offices) signalling cabins, PWIs Sub -PWIs and IOWs \\noffices and depots, Signal Inspectors’ Officers and depots.  OHE Maintenance depots, OHE inspection car \\nsheds, substations, switching station cubicles, loco sheds etc.   \\n \\nIt should be noted that standard printed charts for ‘Treatment for electric shock’ are meant for voltages upto \\n1100 Volts.  A person in contact with higher voltages should be isolated only after ‘switching off power’.  \\n 2   General ‘Caution No tices’ regarding danger of high voltage traction wires for public at various entrances to \\nrailway station and for staff at prominent places at each station, particularly on stanchions or pillars supporting \\nplatform roof.  \\n \\n3.  “25 Kv Cautions Boards” shall affixed on to the screens erected on foot over and road over bridges.  \\n \\n4. ‘Danger’ boards on level crossing height gauges.  \\n5. ‘Engine Stop’ boards, at termination of OHE in the sections to be energized.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL –VOLUME II PART I      196 \\n6\"Caution -Unwired Turn out\" boards ahead of all unwired turn -outs or crossovers taking off from \\nwired tracks.  \\n7.\"Warning\" boards for neutral sections.  \\n8.Boards for \"Switching on\" and \"Switching off\" of power at neutral sections. Four boards are \\nrequi red for each track as detailed in Chapter 11, Vol. 1.  \\n9.\"Danger\" boards to be installed on OHE near watering stations, if any.  \\n10.\"25 kV Caution\" boards at sub -stations and switching stations.  \\n11.\"Caution\" notices on all diesel, electric and steam locos  which work on the energized section, \\nincluding those owned by private parties.  \\n \\n12.\"Caution\" boards at such signal posts where protective screening cannot be provided for signal \\nand telecommunication staff.  \\n \\n20963 Recording of Defects and Rectifications   \\nDuring the detailed inspection, defects and deficiency lists as indicated in para 20903 shall be jointly \\nprepared.  \\n \\nAs soon as the defects are rectified, the open line officers should be advised and suitable remarks \\nmade against  \\neach Item of the list. The open line officer and his staff, if deemed necessary, re -cheek the \\nInstallation, to ensure rectification of defects.                           -  \\n \\n20964 General Inspection of the OHE by Divisional Officers  \\n \\nAfter all major defects observed during deta iled inspection have been rectified  \\'Sr\\' DEE/DEE (TrD) \\nof the open line and Dy. CEE(OHE) of the construction organization shall carry out a 11 General \\nInspection\" of the entire section proposed for energization, along with the Contractor\\'s \\nrepresentative.  For this purpose, an OHE inspection car fitted with pantograph shall be used and \\nrun at a speed not exceeding 8 km/h observing all safety precautions laid down, such as earthing \\nthe OHE. The pantograph may be used to measure height and stagger of contact wire, which \\nshould be test checked at least at two locations per track km.  \\n \\nThe object of this \"General Inspection\" Is to make sure that the OHE and connected installations are \\nin good order and are fit for energization. During this inspection, the whole installation shall be \\ninspected visually observing, in particular, the following details and looking for any thing unusual or \\nabnormal in the installation :  \\n \\n1.   Cantilever assemblies, positioning of fittings, stagger of contact wire, lift of the steady arm in \\ncurves where the radial pull of contact wire tends to move the steady arm upwards, kinks or twists in \\ncontact wire, infringement of section insulators and conductors in overlap spans or any deformity \\nsuffered anywhere. Any loose wires hanging anywhe re or other obstructions shall be observed, and \\nany abnormality removed or rectified immediately.  \\n2.   Clearances to live metal parts of insulators on out -of-run wires should be atleast 2 m from the \\nadjacent structures (other than OHE).  \\nDuring this inspe ction, spot checks shall be conducted at as many places as possible to verify \\nwhether the detailed inspection by the senior subordinates has been thorough, to confirm that the defects noticed earlier have been rectified and to make sure that the installati ons are in excellent \\norder and suitable, for energization subject to final pre -comrnissioning tests.  \\n \\n20965 Lapping and Polishing of OHE  \\n \\nAfter the OHE is ready in all respect, lapping and polishing of contact wire be undertaken to remove \\nall dirt collec ted  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    197 \\non the contact face with the pentograph.  For this purposes an electric loco pentograph raised and hauled by \\na diesel loco may be use at a speed of 15 to 20kmp/h during the first run and no t more than 40kmp/h in \\nsubsequent runs. Alternatively, an OHE inspection car may be used. It is an advantage if before lapping by \\npantograph under side of contact wire is manually cleaned by rubbing and wiping with a wet cloth and \\ndetergent and finally wip e with clean cloth. Normally 3 to 4 runs for lapping and polishing may be done.  \\nWhen lapping and polishing is in progress suitable safety precautions to block the section and earthing of the \\nline as per rules, should be taken and work is supervised at a le vel not less than CTFO.  \\n \\n20966 Procedure for Final Test of OHE  \\nAfter the OHE is declared as fit for energization and all construction staff have been withdrawn from the field, \\ninsulation and continuity test shall be conducted jointly by officers of the con struction organization and the \\nopen line with assistance of senior subordinates.  This should be done at least a day in advance of \\nenergization. This tests should be conducted for every elementary section.  The following preliminary  action \\nshall be taken to prepare the circuit for the test.  \\n \\nTo carry out the test in a systematic manner, a detailed programme of work should be prepare.  A senior, \\nexperienced official should be nominated for controlling the movements of all working parties each of whom \\nwill b e given a copy of the programme with specific instructions as to the sequence of switching operations to \\nbe carried out. This preliminary action should be taken atleast a week in advance of  the date fixed for the test.  \\n \\nOn the day of  test, interruptors an d circuit breakers at all switching stations shall be taken on ‘local’ control \\nand RC put out of operation. All interruptors and double -pole switches are then opened and locked in the \\nopen position’Danger -Men Working’ boards should be attached to the opera ting handle of each 25 kV isolator \\nat feeding post.  All potential and auxiliary transformers at switching stations should be temporarily \\ndisconnected from the busbars.  All other isolating switches in the various yards and other locations provided \\nfor iso lation of elementary section also be plays in the “off” position.  When all these operation are completed \\na confirmatory message shall be sent to the TPC.  \\n \\nThe test shall be controlled by one senior official who shall continuously remain at the RCC and dir ect al \\noperations as required.  Basically, these tests comprise - \\n \\n1. Measurement of insulation resistance of every elementary section with respect to earth.  \\n2. Checking electrical independence and insulation resistance between adjacent elementary section and \\nalso adjacent sub -sectors.  \\n3. Checking  electrical continuity of every sub -sectors.  \\n \\nThe test shall be carried out by one party with the assistance of two or more field parties as required.  The \\ncontrol party alone will carry with it all test instruments and tak e measurements.  The field parties will merely \\ncarry out instructions given.  They should have with them necessary jumper connection and earthing poles for \\nearthing the equipment when directed to do so  .The field parties are forbidden to carry out any ope rations on \\ntheir own.  As the different working parties will be working at different locations, independent from one \\nanother, they should carry with them portable telephones through which they will remain in continuous contact with TPC through emergency te lephones circuit.  In case the emergency telephone circuit is not \\navailable,alternative arrangements shall be made by S&T Department for telephone communication.  \\n \\nAlong with the control party carrying out the tests, the Contractors shall attach a work part y who will \\naccompany the control party from location to location and rectify any defects which may come to light during \\nthe tests.  \\n20967 Insulation Tests  \\nStarting from the feeding post, the control party will measure and record the insulation resistance of  every  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME II PART I      198 \\nelementary section to earth by a 2500 V megger, after arranging with the out -field parties to (i) \\nisolate the elementary section concerned and (I!) earth adjacent elementary sections. Th is test will \\nshow -  \\n \\n1. the insulation level of every elementary section; and  \\n \\n2. the electrical independence of the elementary section, from adjacent elementary sections.  \\n \\nIf the tests for all elementary sections at that location are satisfactory, the control party may proceed \\nto the next elementary section and carry out similar tests. when all elementary sections at a \\nparticular station have been tested, the control party will move to the next station, directing the field \\nparties to do likewise and car ry out the tests on each elementary section at that station as before \\nuntil every elementary section in the sector has been tested.  \\n \\nDuring the course of construction work, erection staff usually provide temporary earths, using a \\nshort piece of binding wi re on the OHE at certain locations to safeguard themselves, but after the \\nwork is completed these temporary earths may not have been removed by oversight. Such \\ntemporary earths on the OHE will give misleading readings during the final insulation test and c ause \\nannoyance. To prevent this, Contractors should be particularly instructed earlier to remove all such \\ntemporary earths.  \\n \\nGuide Lines for Minimum Permissible Insualtion Resistance  \\n \\nIt Is very difficult to lay down any specific rules in regard to the m inimum permissible values, as they \\ndepend upon a number of factors, which should he taken into account when fixing the value In any \\ngiven case. Some of these factors are mentioned below.  \\n \\n1.. Voltage rating has an important bearing on the minimum value ne cessary, before switching on \\nsupply. Obviously, the higher the voltage rating, the greater should be the insulation resistance.  \\n \\n2. Condition of Equipment : The insulation resistance for new equipment should necessarily be \\nmuch more than for the same equi pment after a few years of service. Similarly, the value required \\n(after an equipment has been overhauled, cleaned, dried out) before being turned out of the repair \\nshop should be appropriately higher than when the same equipment was in service before bein g \\nbrought into the shops. A unit which is lying idle for some time may show a comparatively low \\nmegger reading merely because of absorption of moisture and yet its insulation may be good and it \\nwould work satisfactorily when put into service; the absorbed moisture would soon be driven out \\nwhen it is loaded up and the insulation resistance would automatically improve.  \\n \\n3. Type of equipment : It is a fundamental fact that the larger the number of leakage paths, the lower \\nwould the insulation value tend to be . Assuming that the voltage rating and the type of insulation \\nprovided for two armatures are Identical it is obvious that the one with a commutator will have a \\nlower value of insulation resistance, than one with mere slip rings.  \\n \\nFor the same reason, the insulation resistance of 25 kV OHE tends to be quite low, Assuming that \\neach support Insulator has a value of 500 megohm, an elementary section may have 50 of them in \\nparallel, bringing down the overall value to 10 meg ohms. Smoke pollution will greatly di minish this \\ntoo. A single badly polluted section insulator may easily bring down the value to half a meg ohm or less. While one would not dream of switching on supply to a 3.3 kV transformer showing so low a \\nreading - 25 kV supply is commonly switched on to  the OHE even in such cases since the \\naccumulated dust and smoke particles, which are responsible for the low value of resistance, soon \\nget burnt out, and the insulation resistance usually improves greatly after energization.  .  \\n \\nSize of plant :Some of th e formulae commonly used are  \\nLarge AC motors    :                       V                             \\n-------------------------         at 75\"C  \\n                 1000 + (kW/100)  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS, - AC.TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    199  \\n \\nLarge DC mo tors     V \\n      ------------------------ at 75 0 C \\n1000 - + kW  \\n \\nHaving referred to the various factors which should be taken into account in fixing the minimum \\nvalue of insulation resistance, a few thumb rules are given below for guidance: -  \\n \\nInsulation r esistance in megohoms to earth at room temperature (40 0 C)  \\n \\n1.

Any \\ntemporary earths provided for earthing adjacent sections shall be removed. When this is done, the \\nvarious elementary sections are automatically joined up electrically and e ach sub -sector is made \\nthrough\\' The continuity test is then conducted by a low reading ohm -meter by measuring the \\nresistance of each sub -sector from the feeding post and with each sub -sector earthed at the farthest point towards the neutral section. The th rough continuity of every sub -sector shall be checked \\nindividually. It is important to note that a megger insulation tester is unsuitable for measuring \\ncontinuity as It may read zero even when the resistance is as high as 1000 ohms.  \\n \\nIf the tests show up any defects on the line, -they should be rectified at once. Sometimes, it may be \\nfound that although the insulation resistance is all right, there is no through continuity on some sub -\\nsectors. The most probable cause for this is a disconnected jumper conne ction at an overlap span. \\nThis should also be immediately traced and rectified.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [200]  \\n \\n20969 Divisional Officers\\' Joint Certificate  \\n \\nThe test results shall be recorded and signed by Sr. DEE Open  line and Construction and forwarded \\nto CEE, along - with other papers for sanctioning energization in his capacity as Electrical Inspector.  \\n \\nVII. GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS  \\n \\n20970 Preparation for Operating Electrified Services  \\n \\nWhile the engineers are busy car rying out tests and trials of electric equipment to get everything \\nready by the target date fixed for commissioning, several steps have to be taken by the Operating \\nDepartment to be ready to operate the electrified services when the section is commissioned . The \\nDOM of the open line and the DOM of the construction organization shall both be jointly responsible \\nfor the following :  \\n \\n1.   The Rules and Regulations concerning operation, namely General and Subsidiary Rules, \\nRevised Station Working Rules to come into operation after introduction of electric traction, relevant \\nChapters of this Manual shall be handed over to every Station Master on the section to be \\nelectrified. In addition It is essential that the Implications of these rules and procedures should n ot \\nonly be explained to the concerned staff, but they should be examined verbally to make sure that \\nthey do understand them and further, their assurance In writing to that effect should be obtained.  \\n \\nThe training of Station Masters, Section Controllers, C abin staff and other categories in the special \\nrules and procedures applicable to 25 kV traction is best arranged at a short orientation course for \\nthe purpose in the Zonal Training School.  \\n \\n2. (a) At every station on the electrified section, a large scal e Sectioning Diagram, should be \\nexhibited, with the different elementary sections painted in distinguishing colours to help better \\nunderstanding, also showing location of isolating switches, wired and unwired lines etc. The \\nmeaning of these should be expla ined to the concerned staff.  \\n \\n(b) A complete sectioning diagram of the OHE for the relevant section should also be exhibited in \\nthe office of the Section Controller in a similar manner. These diagram shall be kept up dated by \\nOHE supervisors, marking the changes made from time to time.  \\n \\n3.   Sufficient number of \\'Yellow Warning Collars\\' should be supplied to each of the signal cabins; \\nthe cabin staff should be instructed regarding their purpose. They should also be told that no electric \\ntrain or EMU shoul d ever be permitted to enter an unwired line or a section for which power block \\nhas been taken. That they understand the new procedures should be confirmed by them in writing.  \\n \\n4.   Station Masters and Section Controllers should also be fully conversant w ith the system of \\npower blocks and the need for longitudinal and cross protection on electrified lines, and the \\nprecautions to be taken by them in regard to train movements especially oversize consignments.  \\n \\n5.   Station Masters/ Assistant station master should be issued with competency certificates, after \\ngiving practical training, to enable them to operate specific isolators under instructions of TPC.   \\n6,   First Aid boxes and charts showing resuscitation of persons who have suffered electric shock \\nshou ld be kept at every station. As many persons as possible should be trained in the correct \\nmethod of rendering artificial respiration, preferably by a doctor.  \\n \\n7.   The extreme danger of any one coming near line OHE should be fully explained and widely \\npublicized amongst all staff and members of the public. No one should be permitted to ride on roofs \\nof coaches and locomotives.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [201]  \\n8.   The rules for watering of carriages should be distributed to  all TXR and station staff concerned \\nand the procedure fully explained and assurance obtained from them in writing.  \\n \\n \\n9.   On all steam and diesel engines which may enter the electrified section, \\'Caution\\' legends shall \\nbe painted on the side panels. Stea m engine Drivers and the Firemen should be particularly warned \\nthat they should under no circumstances climb up the coal stack on the tender or wield the long \\nsteel rake so as to come any where near the OHE and never direct jets of water on the coal in the  \\ntenders or towards the traction wires. Experience has shown that In spite of such warnings, many \\nan unfortunate loco Driver or Fireman have suffered electrocution: by force of habit they climb up \\nthe coal heap for loco for some work, forgetting the presen ce of OHE in a newly electrified section. \\nDrivers and Firemen should be repeatedly warned of the danger of death due to such carelessness.  \\n \\n10. Traffic staff should be advised of the provision of emergency telephone sockets and their \\nlocations, and instru cted in the correct way of plugging in these telephones into the sockets.  \\n \\nAfter the two DOMs have toured the area and assured themselves that all the above preparatory \\nsteps have been implemented, they shall render a certificate to the effect that the se ction can be \\nopened for public carriage of passengers under electric traction without endangering the safety of \\nthe travelling public or of the employees of the railway.  \\n \\n20971 Preparation by the Engineering Department  \\n \\nThe Divisional Engineer of the ope n line and his counterpart on the construction organization shall \\nalso warn engineering staff In regard to the precautions to be taken by them while working on \\nelectrified sections. The PWIs and the maintenance gangs should be particularly advised that the  \\nalignment of the track with respect to the OHE structures should be strictly preserved and \\nmaintained. Their attention should be drawn to the instructions contained in Chapter 11 Part \\'J\\' of IR \\nPermanent Way Manual for taking the necessary steps to educat e the Permanent Way staff and to \\nequip them with the accessories.  \\n \\n20972 Preparation by the S&T Department  \\n \\nIntroduction of ac 25 kV traction involves a considerable amount of work to be done by the S&T \\nDepartment, to modify the existing circuits, shifti ng of signals, introduction of colour light signals and \\nlaying of appreciable lengths of signal cables apart from providing telecommunication facilities \\nrequired for electric traction.

To discharge \\nthese responsibilities, it is essential to have a clear programme of action to be taken in the final \\nstages of complition to ensure that:  \\n  \\n1. the works carried out departmentally and by contractors are of high  standards.  \\n \\n2. the organization for running the services will  be ready by the time the sections are \\ncommissioned;  \\n \\n3. as and when installations are energized on 25 kV, they are taken over promptly and operated \\nefficiently.  \\n \\n21001 Preparation by Open L ine  \\nThe intention of having electrification works carried out by a separate organisation within the \\nRailway is to relieve the CEE of the Open Line of the burden of detailed design, supervision and \\nexecution of works, departmentally or through Contractor, It is, however, essential for CEE of the \\nOpen Line to keep himself in touch with the developments and progress of works, so that he may \\ntake timely action for taking over the installation on commissioning.  He will have to arrange every \\nother things.  \\n \\n1. creation of an organization, with sufficient number of trained personnel, to take over the operation \\nand maintenance of the electrified section from the date of commissioning  \\n \\n2.recruitment and training of  operating and maintenance staff;   \\n \\n3. close assoc iation of Open Line Officers and staff during the final stages of erection and \\nadjustment work to enable them to study the details of installations;  \\n \\n4. carrying out of detailed inspection of the works by Assistant Officers and senior subordinates \\nfollowe d by general inspection by Senior Officers for getting all defects rectified.  \\n \\n5. final tests and trials with rolling -stock;  \\n \\n6. Administrative Officers\\' inspection and sanction to the energization of substations, switching \\nstations and OHE by Electrical  inspector.  \\n \\n7- final Inspection of OHE and installations by CRS, commissioning and putting into commercial \\nservice -,. and  \\n \\n8, post -commissioning work, operation and maintenance.  \\n \\n21002 Organization for Inspection and Taking Over  \\nThe CEE of the open li ne railway shall set up the organization on the following line:  \\n \\n(1) Create all the posts of officers\\'and staff in accordance with the norms and fill up at least 6 \\nmonths in advance two post of JAG Officers viz . Sr. DEE/TrD and Sr. DEE/RS along with requi site \\nsite staff and supervisors.  \\n(2) when electrification is introduced for the first time on the zonal railway, a nucleus set up at the \\nheadquarters  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1                  [2041   office should also be c reated.  \\n  \\n(3) organize a Training School at least one year in advance/ for the training of maintenance, \\noperation and running staff to man the services.   \\n \\n(4) Recruit maintenance and operating staff and train them to man the services, arrange for \\nselectio n of running staff from steam and diesel cadre and start their conversion training courses at \\nleast a year prior to the date of energization, so as to position adequate number of drivers, assistant \\ndrivers and supervisors in time to take over the services.   \\n \\n(5) Position the Inspectorial cadre to ensure compliance with the requirements laid down in para \\n20970 station by station and to train along with Sr. DSO all the Operating Deptt. staff.  \\n \\n(6) Augment the organizational set up 3 months in advance of the date of commissioning posting \\nadditional officer and staff to ensure detailed joint checks and. rectification of defects in time.  \\n \\n(7) Expedite the completion of facilities for setting up OHE and PSI depots and workshop\\' facilities \\nbuilt by the constructi on unit and arrange to equip the emergency vans, OHE Inspection Cars and \\nother maintenance vehicles to undertake the maintenance and operation. -  \\n \\n(8) If a loco -shed is part of the RE project, some officers and staff should be posted at least 6 \\nmonths bef ore the locos are received so that they can set up the shed facilities jointly with  the \\nconstruction unit, arrange for jigs, fixtures, and other special tools, take over the major plant and \\nmachinery such as cranes for light and heavy lifting bays etc. and  get themselves organized for the \\nmaintenance and operation of the rolling stock         .  \\n \\nHaving nucleus setup of key officers is an important step which enables establishing a good rapport \\nwith, and making full use of the resources of, the construction  organisation in creating full facilities \\nfor the open line maintenance. Opportunity to select right type of men with skill for different jobs \\nfrom a number of sources viz. direct recruitment, other open line units and sheds, contractor\\'s \\nskilled labour et c. can be taken by the officers If they are In position in good time. This enables the \\nchange of traction from the very first day of energization on trial basis and increase it to a very \\nsignificant level immediately after CRS\\'s inspection and sanction for  carriage of passenger traffic.  \\n \\n21003 Duties of Senior Divisional Electrical Engineer (TrD)  \\n1.

He will  arrange fo r screening and conversion training of maintenance staff rendered surplus due \\nto electrification and also recruitment and initial training of balance requirements of staff.  \\n \\n21005 Responsibility of Construction Organisation  \\n \\nThe Construction Organization  is responsible for the execution and completion of works and testing, \\ncommissioning and handing over all. installations in proper working condition to CEE of the Open \\nLine and in particular to ensure that -  \\n \\n1. the design of all installation is in accorda nce with approved standards and where any departure \\nfrom accepted norms becomes necessary approval of Railway Board/ RDSO/ CRS/ Flectrical \\nInspector is obtained;  \\n2. progressing of works is done to comply with the target dates fixed by the Railway Board an d all \\nworks executed are to a high standard;  \\n3. procurement of all special stores, transport vehicles including OHE - inspection cars for \\nmaintenance, tools . and plant, machinery and testing instruments and their handing over to the \\nOpen Line in two stage s the minimum  \\nrequired before tests and trials followed by the balance immediately after installation and \\ncommissioning in done (refer Appendix VI);  \\n4. the CEE informed of all developments and in consultation With him the programme and date for \\ncommissio ning of installations is fixed;  \\n5. copies of all approved , specifications, contract documents and Important letters are furnished to \\nthe CEE. Sufficient number of copies of all , specifications and manufacturer\\'s instruction booklets \\nshould be to the Div isional Officers concerned so that they may be distributed to the maintenance \\nStaff. \"As made drawings\" or tracings incorporating all modifications during construction, \\ncountersigned by the Engineers of the Contractor and construction organization are hand ed over to \\nCEE of the Open Line for safe and permanent custody;  \\n6. exercising necessary co -ordination with the Supply Authorities to ensure that power supply \"I be \\nmade  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART]    [206]  available and with the P & T Department to ensure that all their works will be completed and the \\nnecessary clearance given for energization of the lines well in advance; and  \\n \\n7   complying with all the formalities connected with the energization of all sections in accordanc e \\nwith the rules laid down.  \\n \\n21006 Commissioning of Traction Substations  \\n \\n1. Energization of traction substations is the first step towards commissioning of electric traction on \\na new section of a Railway. This can be done subject to -  \\n \\n(a) Power Supply Authorities being ready to give power supply;  \\n \\n(b) detailed inspection of the substations, protective equipment and connected RC equipment \\nhaving been completed and test being quite satisfactory;  \\n \\n(c) full communication facilities being available;  \\n \\n(d) permission for energization of the substation having been received from CEE and Electrical \\nInspector to the Railway.  \\n \\n2. Norwilly all sub -stations should be commissioned well before the date fixed for energization of \\nOHE for commercial traffic use. With t he sanction of CRS limited trial runs could be undertaken after \\nthe sub -station is commissioned.  \\n \\n3. On the appointed day,necessary clearance certificates should be obtained from the Contractors, \\nDy.CEE(PSI), Officers of the Supply Authority and.others wh o were working at the substation during \\nthe construction period,\\' that their staff have been withdrawn and the substation may be energized. \\nThe 25kV feeder Isolators at the sub - station and feeding post ends should be opened and locked \\nand the 25 kV feeder  conductors solidly earthed by duplicate earths. Readings of the tariff metering \\nequipment should be recorded and the meters jointly sealed by the Open Line Sr.DEE/DEE and the \\nOfficers of the Supply Authority. After final meggering of the whole installatio n, all circuit breakers \\nand isolators are kept in the open position and the \\'remote/local\\' switch put in the \\'local\\' position.  \\n \\nPower supply may then be switched on step by step to the transformers and busbars and the \\nindications on the control panel chec ked. Subject to everything being in order, operation of the \\nvarious control -gear can be checked, followed by tripping of circuit breakers by manually closing the \\ncontacts of the protective relays. Finally, overall confirmatory test may be conducted of the correct \\ntripping of circuit breakers when close against dead -short circuits on the 25 kV busbar. This test will \\nalso confirm If the settings of the grid sub -station relays are properly co -ordinated with the settings \\nof the traction substation relays so tha t the grid substation CB\\'s do not trip for a fault on the 25 kV \\ninstallations.  \\n \\n4. The two transformers may then be kept energized continuously. An experienced supervisory \\nofficial should be deputed to keep a close watch on the equipment for the first thr ee days, followed \\nby a detailed inspection after a week and then after fortnight.  \\n \\nShould a circuit breaker trip during the period, the cause should be carefully investigated. The \\nannunciator panel should be checked to ascertain which of the relays have o perated. Occasionally \\nthe Buchholz relay may operate. A probable cause for this when a transformer is energized for the \\nfirst time is that air bubbles which may have been entrapped between the windings when oil is filled \\ninto the transformer tank, may get released when the transformer gets warmed up and may operate \\nthe Buchholz. However, a careful check is still necessary to ascertain the cause of every tripping.  \\n \\n5. 25 kV power supply may he extended up to the feeding posts if all work on 25 kV feeders an d the \\nfeeding posts has been completed in all respects, after taking the usual safety precautions.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [207]  21007 Sanction of CEE and Electrical Inspector to the Railway  \\n \\n1. Application shall be sub mitted at least a fortnight before energization to CEE and Electrical \\nInspector to the Railway for the following: -  \\n \\n(a) Formal approval, if not already received to the design and layout of all high voltage equipment \\nincluding traction sub -stations, transm ission lines, 25 kV feeders, switching stations, booster \\nstations etc.  \\n \\n(b) Approval for energization of HT installations mentioned above including OHE,  \\n \\n2. The following documents shall accompany the application for El\\'s sanction.  \\n \\n(a) Copies for Press  cuttings of the Public notification as mentioned in para 21008.  \\n \\n(b) Certificate regarding OHE (proforma 10 -03).  \\n \\n(c) Certificate regarding bonding and earthing (proforma 10 -04).  \\n \\n(d) Certificate regarding safety instructions and precautionary measures  (proforrna.10 -05).  \\n \\n(e) Certificate by DRM regarding safety precautions (proforma 10 -06).  \\n \\n(f) Copies of insulation resistance test results of OHE.  \\n \\n(g) Insulation test results values for auxiliary and booster transformers.  \\n \\n(h) Test results for equip ment in switching stations and sub -stations and their safety certificates,if \\nearlier sanction for the energizing this is not o6tained separately.  \\n \\n(I) Clearance certificates form Deptt. of Telecommunication.  \\n \\n0) Any other data, test results and certifica tes required by the Electrical inspector.  \\n \\nThe sanction of the Electrical inspector may be issued in the proforma 10 -07.  \\n \\n21008 Notification Regarding Energization of OHE  \\n \\n1. A notification indicating the intention to energize completed section/s of OHE , a month in advance \\nof the approximate date on which the line is expected to be energized, will  have to be issued to the \\nfollowing: -  \\n \\n(a) The Press.  \\nb)   The CRS and CEE and Electrical Inspector.  \\nc) General Manager, Chief Operating Manager, Chief Enginee r/Construction, Chief \\nCommercial Manager, Chief Mechanical Engineer, Chief Signal and Telecommunication \\nEngineer, Chief Security Officer and Divisional Railway Managers concerned.  \\nd)     Power Supply Authorities.  \\ne)   Posts & Telegraphs Department. .  \\nf)   Field Officers of Railway Electrification.  \\ng)  OHE Contractors  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL   VOLUME 11 PART 1    [208]  \\n (h) Goverment Railway Police.  \\n \\n \\nThe notification shall be issued in the proforma 10 -01 appended.  \\n \\n2. Notification regarding leve l crossing gauges:  \\n \\nAt least a month in advance of the energization of a section, a notification in the proforma 10 -02 \\nappended shall be issued by the concerned Railway for the safety of public and vehicles using level \\ncrossings. This notification shall b e published in local papers and also in the Gazettes of Railways \\nand State Govt.  \\n \\n3. Notification for particular section to be energized:  \\n \\nAt least a fortnight in advance of the probable date of energization, a notification in the proformna \\n10-01 shall b e issued by the field unit of RE construction, notifying all concerned of the energization \\nof the relevant portion of the section.  \\n \\n21009  Application to CRS  \\n1.  Sanction is  required from the CRS in respect of  \\n \\n(a) Introduction of electric traction on a ny railway or section of a railway;  \\n \\n(b) bringing into use any type of electric locomotive or EMU or to operate any in service at speeds \\nhigher than those already sanctioned;  \\n \\n(c) For new yard lines/loop lines/sidings being laid down and electrified: Ele ctrification of existing \\nlines on already electrified sections/loops/sidings/yards lines of length not more than 2 km \\npermission to introduce electric traction shall be granted by Electrical Inspector.  \\n \\n2. Prior to the energization of any section, the fol lowing certificates and documents shall be \\nsubmitted to the CRS: -  \\n \\n(a) General Safety Certificate of Works, signed by CEE and CSTE of the Construction Organization.  \\n \\n(b) Safety Certificate for electrical works signed by CEE of Open Line and CPM/CEE/Dy. C EE of the \\nRE Organisation.  \\n \\n(c) Safety Certificate in respect of electric rolling -stock signed by CEE, CME, COM and CE of the \\nOpen Line Railway.  \\n \\n(d) Certificate of Open Line Officers about the knowledge of their staff regarding safety rules for \\nelectrif ied sections.  \\n \\n(e) Certificate issued by DRM of Open Line regarding introduction of safety measures, issue of \\nSpecial Station Working Rules and obtaining assurance of the staff concerned regarding their \\nknowledge of rules applicable to ac traction.  \\n \\nf)  Copies of Station Working Rules which have been distributed to the various Station Masters.  \\n \\n2 1 0 1 0 Procedure for Energization  \\n1. The inspection of the entire section will be carried out by means of an OHE Inspection car by  \\nCRS alongwith CEE or his HO DS, Chief Project Manager (CPM)/RE alongwith their concerned \\nofficers and the concerned Divisional Officers. During this inspection particular attention is paid to \\nthe safety and operational aspects of the  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11  PART 1    [209]  train movements and that staff are in possession of statutory rule books, Instructions Book, \\nRegisters, forms etc. and that transportation, Electrical, P -Way and S&T staff are fully acquainted \\nwith their duties after ac traction is introdu ced. CRS may issue sanction to energize the OHE and \\nauthorise trial runs with light electric locomotive as well as a few goods trains.  \\n \\n2. Wide publicity through the Press and posters given earlier would keep the public fully informed \\nabout the proposal t o electrify the lines and warned to danger of live OHE. The Station Masters \\nshould, nevertheless, advise and warn all passengers of the danger of 25 kV OHE and not allow \\nthem to ride on the roofs of coaches. All Diesel and Steam engine Drivers should also be advised \\nthat they should, under no circumstances, climb over engines or tenders when they are under the \\nOHE, as they will endanger their lives by coming close to the live OHE. Train watering staff should \\nalso be cautioned so that they may not Inadverten tly climb on the carriages, by old habit.  \\n \\nEnergization of OHE..  \\n \\n3. On the appointed day and hour, all concerned will  assemble either at a feeding post or at the \\nRCC assuming it has already been commissioned. The entire energization operation shall be \\ncarried out under one Senior Electrical Officer who will be nominated for the purpose. He AI first \\ncollect the following Clearance Certificates: -  \\n \\n(a) Certificate from Contractors working on OHE, switching stations, booster transformer stations, \\nRC and a lso from other agencies whose staff were engaged on construction works, to the effect that \\ntheir men have been withdrawn from work, that they have been warned that installations would be \\nenergized and that no work be done thereafter without obtaining a per mit-to-work.  \\n \\n(b) Joint Certificate by the RE and Open Line Sr.DEEs stating that they have withdrawn their staff \\nand warned them as above and that the installation has been jointly inspected and is fit for \\nenergization and also that due precautions have b een taken to protect contiguous sections where \\nmen may be working.  \\n \\n(c) Certificate issued by S&T Officers that their work has been completed and the OHE can be \\ncharged at 25 kV ac.  \\n(d) Certificate of the CEE and Electrical Inspector of the Railway permi tting energization.  \\n(e) Sanction of the CRS permitting operation of ac rolling -stock and energization of the OHE.  \\n(f) Certificate of clearance from DOT for energisation of OHE; provided further that no such \\nclearance shall be necessary in cases of additi ons and. alterations to traction Installations on \\nexisting electrified routes where CEE and EIG is satisfied that the amount and nature of traction \\nenergy transmitted in the system as a whole, will remain unaltered.  \\n \\nStandard forms for issue of typical ce rtificates and notification mentioned in this chapter are \\nappended at the end of this Chapter.  \\n \\n4. The Senior Electrical Officer in -charge of the energization programme will  supervise the detailed \\nsequence of operations to switch on 25 kV supply progress ively, step by step, starting with 25 kV \\nfeeders from the sub -station to the feeding post, busbars of the feeding post, followed by one sub -\\nsector after another until the whole section is energized. It is best to start by keeping all circuit \\nbreakers and i nterruptors in the open position so that one after the other they may be switched on \\naccording to a prearranged programme. The merit of this procedure is that a faulty sub -sector, if \\nany, is immediately identified. Alternatively, the whole section covered by a sub -station may be \\nenergized at one go. Should the feeder circuit breaker trip, it will be necessary to identify the faulty \\nsub-sector and arrange for its rectification. Before commencing energization, certain essential staff \\nshould be kept ready at s trategic locations enroute to rectify any faults which may be detected,  \\n5. A short time after the energization of OHE confirmatory tests for proper operation of the protective \\nrelays as per para 20931 shall be carried out.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - Ad TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [210]   \\n21013 Sanction of CRS  \\nSubject to the trial run being satisfactory, an \"all concerned message\" may be issued by the CRS \\ncommunicating his sanction for the introduction of commercial services.  \\n \\nAfter the receipt of CRS\\'s  sanction, commercial services may be commenced either immediately or \\nsubsequently. It is, however, desirable wherever possible to cheek the performance of the electric \\nlocomotives and OHE for sparkless current collection at different speeds during night t ime, when \\nhauling a fully loaded train. These tests may be conducted jointly be Dy.CEE(OHE)(RE), Sr. \\nDEE(TRD) and Sr. DEE (PS) along with representatives of the OHE Contractor. Defective working \\nnoticed shall be rectified as soon as possible and on success ful completion of the tests, a joint \\ncertificate shall be given confirming that full commercial working may be introduced.  \\n \\n21014 Anti -theft Energization  \\nTo over come the problem of copper wire thefts, it may sometimes be necessary to charge the \\nconducto rs at 2.2 kV. Guidelines for such charging of OHE are given in the Appendix Vii to this \\nVolume.  \\n \\n 21015 Responsibility for Maintenance and Provisional Acceptance Certificate  \\n1. When a long sections is under Electrification, shorter sub -sections are often  energized as an anti -\\ntheft measure. Till such time commercial services are not Introduced after CRS\\'s inspection and \\nsanction, the OHE and other power supply and switching installations shall be maintained by the \\nconstruction organisation.  \\n \\n2. With the e nergization of the OHE and CRS\\'s sanction and introduction of commercial services, all \\nelectrical equipment including sub -stations and all other connected equipment are deemed as \\nhaving been taken over the Open Line of the Railway and thereafter the respon sibility for operation \\nand maintenance shall devolve on the Divisional Officers concerned.  \\n \\nHowever, in order to ensure that all works are completed by the construction organisation, a specific \\n\"Handing Over\" procedure may be evolved by openline CEE, CSTE  & CE to bring out left over work \\nif any; to be completed even after introduction of commercial services. The construction \\norganisation shall have such work completed in a reasonable period.  \\n \\n3. A letter of \"provisional acceptance\" shall then be issued by  the head of the Construction \\nOrganization to the \\'various Contractors in respect of the equipment erected and handed over by \\nthem. Should the test results for any particular equipment or Installation be unsatisfactory, an \\nextension may be given to the Con tractor to have the defects set right and to hand over the \\ninstallation in good condition. When this has been done, a separate letter of acceptance shall be \\nissued in respect of such equipment. The provisional acceptance certificate shall be jointly signed  \\nby the concerned Dy. CEE of the Railway Electrification Organization and Sr. DEE (TrD) and \\nContractor\\'s authorized representative. ,  \\n \\n21016 Contractor\\'s Responsibility During Guarantee Period  \\n1. This is defined by the terms of the contract. Norwilly, th e Contractor of a \"supply and erection\" \\ncontract guarantees the satisfactory operation of all equipment and Installations for a period of \\ntwelve months from the date of issue of \"provisional acceptance certificate\". The contractor provides \\nthe services of an experienced Engineer to maintain liaison with Officers of the Open Line and the \\nConstruction Organization and help in rectification of defects observed and investigation of serious \\nbreakdowns of equipment, and advise on the maintenance procedures. The c ontractor is expected \\nto bear the cost of all modifications, additions and substitutions which may be considered necessary \\ndue to faulty materials, design or workmanship of the installations for which he is responsible.  \\n  \\n2. Most of the heavy equipment fo r sub -stations, switching  stations, booster stations etc. are \\nusually obtained from different manufacturers against a \"Supply Contract\". In such cases, the usual \\nguarantee clause provides for suppliers responsibility for a period of 12 months from the dat e of \\ncommissioning or 18 months from the date  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART     212  of supply -whichever is earlier. A clear record should, therefore, be maintained of the dates of receipt \\nof the equipment and the dates of energiza tion of each equipment so that the period of responsibility \\nof the Contractor is clearly defined.  \\n \\n3. It is essential for the Electrical Officers and Supervisors concerned to make a careful study of the \\ncontract documents so that appropriate action may be  taken as circumstances dictate. In regard to \\nthe defects noticed during the guarantee period the procedure to be followed for reporting and \\ninvestigation are described in the next para.  \\n \\n21017 Failure of Equipment After Commissioning and During the Guara ntee Period  \\n \\nAlthough during this period the equipment is operated and maintained by the Open Line Railway \\nEngineers, the procedure described below should invariably be followed to ensure that defects \\nnoticed during the guarantee period are rectified by M anufacturers under the Guarantee Clause.  \\n \\n1. Instructions issued by the manufacturers for operation and maintenance should be strictly \\nfollowed by the Railway. If any modification is required, approval of the Manufacturers should first \\nbe obtained. The st andard Guarantee Clause provides that the equipment shall be free from defects \\nin material and workmanship during manufacture. The liability of the supplier in this respect is \\nnorwilly limited to the supply and installation of replacement parts, free of ch arge, and repair of \\ndefective parts noticed during normal usage of the equipment as also those, attributed to faulty \\ndesign of the equipment. If the equipment becomes irreparable the supplier will have to replay the \\nsame in its entirety.  \\n \\n2. It is essenti al that any defect noticed is brought to the attention of the supplier without delay. A \\nclear record of defects and deficiencies noticed shall he entered in a register by the Open Line \\nOfficer and the date of intimation to supplier recorded against each it em.  \\n \\n3. When an equipment fails, the Sr.DEE shall first make an inspection of the equipment on the spot \\nwith the least possible delay along -with the representative of the Contractor. The presence of the \\nManufacturer\\'s or Contractor\\'s representative is ess ential and should be ensured during the joint \\ninspection to avoid disputes later on. The defective equipment shall not be dismantled or disturbed \\nexcept with the approval of, or in the presence of, the representative of the supplier, to avoid \\nobliteration of any important evidence which could help in  investigation of the defect. After the \\ninspection, a joint report shall be prepared recording the relevant data such as -  \\n \\n(a) Full particulars of the equipment - date received and  date commissioned.  \\n(b) Ful l circumstances in which failure occurred.  \\n(c) Observations and tests made  \\n(d) Probable cause that could lead to the failure.  \\n(e) Recommendations, long term and short term, for preventing such failures in future.  \\n \\n4. -Should there be repeated failures of the same type, the cause of failure should be investigated \\nintensively, taking all connected factors Into account such as switching operations carried out, \\nmaintenance work done etc. These factors should be statistically analyzed. A report on the failur e of \\nthe equipment should be sent promptly to the supplier of the equipment endorsing a copy to the \\nCOS, Inspection Agency, CEE and RDSO.  \\n \\nIn the case of works contracts, too, the same procedure should be followed.  \\n \\n6. According to the provision of the c ontract, in the event of design defects, the contractor\\'s liability \\nis not only limited to repair/replacement of the components/equipments affected; but also to all other \\ncomponents in similar situation/ condition. even though they may not have failed in s ervice, have to \\nbe replaced or modified by the supplier. This aspect needs careful study by the Sr.DEEs.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    213  21018  History Sheet  \\n \\nMaintenance of a History sheet for each major equipment is very imp ortant as this will give a \\nconnected account of all failures of the equipment and particulars of repairs carried out and will  be \\nof great help in investigating recurring failures.   \\n \\n21019  Final Accentance Certificates  \\n \\nImmediately after the comletion of  the guarantee period, a’ final acceptance certrificate’ shall be \\njointly signed by the Sr. DEE of the concerned Railway and Contractor ‘s representative and \\ncountersigned by the head of the cCnstruction Organisation and issued to the Contractor, provided \\nthat the terms of the Guarantee Clause have been fulfilled.

Incoming Power Supply  \\n \\nThe incoming power supply scheme is similar to 25 kV simple feed system. Power supply for ac \\ntraction is obtained from the nearest grid sub -station of the Power Supply Authority. For this  purpose \\nduplicate feeders, generally at 132 kV or 22OkV, comprising only two phases are provided from the \\ngrid sub -station to traction substation.  \\n \\nThe loads, however, are 2 -3 times higher compared to.25 kV system and therefore Wood -bridge/V -\\nconnected tr ansformers are provided in the traction substations to bring down the unbalance within \\nacceptable limits. It is possible to absorb such unbalances without exceeding the permissible limits if \\nthe grid system capacity is adequate.  \\n \\n2. Power Receiving Arrang ement: Traction Sub -station  \\n \\nThe incoming extra high voltage power is stepped do\" to 2x25 kV by the main traction power \\ntransformer. The 2x25 kV supply is then fed to an auto -transformer. One terminal of the auto -\\ntransformer is connected to the overhead c atenary wires and the other terminal to a feeder wire \\nwhich runs parallel to overhead contact/catenary wire all along the section and is usually supported \\nfrom super masts fixed on the OHE structures. The mid point of the auto -transformer is connected \\nto the rail, thus providing a 25 kV supply, with reference to the rail potential, for traction.  \\n \\nThe capacity of the auto -transformers and their spacing is decided based on the traffic pattern in the \\nsection.  \\n \\nThe general arrangement of the scheme for 2x25 k V auto -transformer feeding system is indicated at \\nFig. 1. 0 1 This is for a Scott connected transformer substation.  \\n \\n3. Distribution of Traction Power Supply  \\n \\nFeeding Post (,FP)  \\n \\nThe arrangement at the feeding post is generally similar to that at the 25  kV conventional system \\nfeeding post.  \\n \\nSectioning and Paralleling Post (SP)  \\n \\nA short neutral section is provided in the OHE opposite the feeding post as well as mid -way \\nbetween two adjacent traction substations. The feeder wire is also provided with a neu tral section by \\nmeans of two cut -in insulators coincidental in space with the ends of the neutral section.  \\n \\nSub-sectioning and Paralleling Post (SSP)  \\nThe arrangement at the SSP is generally similar to that at the 2SkV conventional SSP system.  \\n \\nAuto-Tran sformer Post  \\n \\nThese are provided adjacent to the track through -out the length of the section. The spacing and \\ncapacity of the auto -transformers is decided as a part of system design based on specific \\nrequirements and traffic pattern. Typically the spacing  is 15 km and capacity 2 MVA. Distribution of \\ncurrent in AT system is shown in Fig. 11.02.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART    [226]   \\n \\n \\n  \\ndynamic conditions. The proposed car will be of trailer type, suitabl e for running at speeds of 160 \\nkm/h with potential to run up to 200 km/h. The car shall be hauled by locomotive or attached to a \\ntrain. The car will be provided with on -board computer based data acquisition and processing \\nsystem. The facility for video rec ording of arcs generated due to interruption in current drawn by \\nlocomotive as a result of loss of contact between pantograph and the OHE is also proposed to be \\nprovided.  \\n \\n4. The various parameters proposed to be monitored are:  \\n \\nMeasurements on pantograp h:  \\na)   acrodynamic upward force of the pantograph;  \\nb) contact force between pantograph and contact wire;  \\nc) vertical and horizontal movement of pantograph;  \\nd) quality of current collection - loss of contact;  \\n \\nMeasurements on OHE:  \\na) height of contact wire ;  \\nb) stagger of the contact wire;  \\nc) gradient of the contact wire;  \\n d) detection of hard spots;  \\ne) checking of crossovers and turn -outs;  \\nf) body vertical acceleration;  \\ng) body lateral acceleration;  \\nh)   quality of current collection - loss of contact.  \\n \\n21102 Rail -cum -Road Vehicle  \\nSuch a vehicle is suitable for propulsion both on the road as well as on the track. Two sets of \\nwheels are provided for this purpose. This vehicle is provided with an extendible swivelling platform. \\nThe vehicle can be driven on road to t he level crossing nearest to the work site and taken there on \\nthe track.  \\n \\n21103 Transportable Self Propelled Trolley  \\n \\nThis is a self propelled trolley which can be transported by a truck to a point accessible through \\nroad, close to the work site, for car rying out work on OHE. The trolley is provided with extendible \\nswivelling platform.  \\n \\n21104 Dry Type Booster Transformer and Auxiliary Transformers  \\n \\nConventional oil filled transformers require lot of care and attention for maintaining the characteristic \\nof oil within the permissible limits to avoid failure of Insulation.  \\n \\nDry type cast resin transformer is a relatively new technology. The chief advantage of this type of \\ntransformer over the oil filled ones is that they are practically maintenance free. T he copper in the \\nwindings cannot be retrieved from the cast resin and so the risk of theft is eliminated. There being \\nno oil risk of fire and explosion are also absent. Dry cast resin transformers are currently under \\nevaluation for their service performanc e.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [229]   \\n \\n21105 Static Distance Protection Relay for Protection of OHE  \\n \\n \\n1. For the distance protection of the overhead equipment, the relay which is in use is the \\nelectromechanical type. This  relay has a Mho characteristic as illustrated in Fig, 1 1.03. The relay is \\nprone to trip on normal over loads because of its inadequate discrimination between load current \\nand the fault current when the fault is at the farther end causing undesirable trip ping of the feeder \\ncircuit breaker. This problem will be more acute in the future due to the further increase in traffic \\nanticipated and the increase in the traction power transformer capacity at TSS.  \\n \\n2.To over -come the above problem RDS0 has developed a  static type distance protection relay. \\nThis relay is a three zone relay,the first two zones having MhO characteristic and the third zone \\nhaving a lenticular characteristic with adjustable aspect ratio. The relay characteristic is illustrated in \\nFig.11.04.  While the first zone operation is instantaneous, the second and third zones have \\nadjustable time settings (zero to Is). The first zone can be set to cover about 80% of the OHE from \\nTSS to SP, the second zone to cover a distance which is slightly shorter t han the distance to the \\nadjacent  TSS and the third zone may cover the adjacent TSS. By providing a time delay of about 0. \\n4s to 0. 5s in the second zone/third zone of the relay, adequate discrimination between faults from \\nTSS to SP and SP to the adjacent TSS can be achieved - the under voltage relay at the SP acting \\nas primary protection and the second/third zones of the distance relay at TSS acting as back up \\nprotection for faults beyond SP in case of feed extension. The settings of the various zones of t he \\nrelay should be based on the RDSO\\'s guidelines in this regard.  \\n \\n3. As an alternative to the static distance relay described above, the static relay with parallelogram \\ncharacteristic as illustrated in Fig. 11.05 can also be used. At present these relays  have to be \\nimported. However, efforts to develop these relays indigenously are on. The advantages of this \\nrelay as compared with the electromechanical relay with Mho characteristic are similar to those of \\nthe static relay described above. The relay settin gs for this relay also should be based on the \\nRDSO\\'s guidelines in this regard.  \\n \\n21106 Composite Insulators  \\n \\nThe conventional porcelain insulators have poor impact withstand capability. The sheds of such \\ninsulators are easily broken during handling and a lso due to acts of vandalism. The glazed surface \\nof porcelain also does not have good hydrophobic property. These limitations can be overcome to a \\ngreat extent with the use of composite insulators. The composite insulator comprises a porcelain \\n(alumino) or  a resin bonded glass fibre core and moulded sheds of elastomeric/plastic material e.g., \\nsilcone elastomer or poly -tetra-fluoro -ethylene (PTFE). The interface between the core and the \\nsheds is sealed with special compound to prevent ingress of moisture and  direct tracking along the \\nlength of the core. The end fittings are usually crimped to the core. Such insulators have exhibited \\nexcellent performance in simulated pollution tests. They also have excellent impact withstand \\ncapability. Efforts are on in RDSO  to introduce such insulators.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -\\'AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME 11 PART 1    [231]  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  CHAPTER XII  \\n \\nTRAINING AND COMPETENCY CERTIFICATES  \\n \\n      I TRAINING  \\n \\nPara Nos.

TRAINING  \\n \\n21200 Introduction  \\n \\nElectric traction is a specialized field. Efficient operation and maintenance of the traction \\ninstallations and equipment is only possible if the staff concerned have acquired an intimate \\nknowledge of the details of construction, adjustments and operation of the equipment. A thorough \\nknowledge of the special rules and procedures on the part of the staff is also essential to ensure \\nsafety of equipment and personnel. These requirements call for specialized training for all \\ncategories of staff before they can be entrusted with the responsibility for maintenance or operation.  \\n \\n21201 Planning of Trainin g  in Advance  \\n \\nBefore electric traction is commissioned on any section, adequate strength of weft -trained operating, \\nmaintenance and running staff should be kept ready for manning the services. Planning the \\nrecruitment and training of such staff well in a dvance is one of the most important tasks of the open \\nline administration. It is  also necessary to establish sufficiently in advance suitable training schools \\nwith the facilities for imparting the training by qualified instructors.  \\n \\n21202 Categories to b e Trained  \\n \\nCategories of staff for whom special training is required to he organized are generally as under -  \\n \\n \\n1. Degree and Diploma holders recruited directly as Supervisors  \\n \\n2. Apprentice Mechanics to be absorbed as Supervisors  \\n \\n3. Trade Apprentices to be absorbed as, skilled artisans  \\n \\n4. Artisans and supervisory staff to undergo Refresher Courses.  \\n \\n21203 Initial Training  \\n \\n1. Categories of staff mentioned below should receive a period of initial training in a training school \\nbefore they are posted to working posts -  \\n \\na)Directly recruited supervisors;  \\n \\nb)Traction Power Controllers and Asstt. Traction Power Controllers;  \\n \\nc)Skilled and semi -skilled artisan staff for maintenance of OHE, PSI and RC equipment;  \\n \\nd)Any other category as approved by CEE.  \\n \\n2.   The period of initial training for typical categories is given below, this may be modified by CEE in \\naccordance with local requirements :  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1    [234]  a) Directly recruited supervisors (Degre e and Diploma Holders) -  \\n \\ni) OHE          12 months  \\nii) PSI       12 months  \\niii) Remote Control     12 months  \\niv) TPCs/ATPCS     18 months  \\n \\nb) Skilled artisans for maintenance -  \\n \\ni) Direct recruits     60 weeks  \\nii) To be absorbed from Diesel/Steam  30 weeks  \\n or Electric general services  \\n \\n \\n3.   In addition to theoretical training, the trainees should receive thorough practical training on the \\nwork they will have to perform on completion of training. In all cases they should have a period as \\nunder -study to senior and experienced staff in actual execution of the type of work they have to \\nperform on completion of training.  \\n \\n4.   For artisan staff the practical training should be so oriented as to enable them to understand and \\nbe able to carry out independe ntly skilled work of the type covered by \\'Inspection books\\', \\'Inspection \\ncharts\\', \\'trouble - shooting charts\\' and\\' technical charts\\'. Courses of training for each separate branch \\nviz. OHE, PSI and RC should be carefully planned and implemented for each cate gory of staff.  \\n \\n21204 Promotional Courses  \\n \\n1. No employee should be promoted unless he passes the trade test or other prescribed \\ndepartmental test.  \\n \\n2.   Before an employee can be promoted, he should, as a rule, receive training to enable him to \\ndischar ge his responsibilities in the higher post e.g., a semi -skilled fitter on promotion as a skilled \\nfitter. Such training should precede the departmental tests which determine suitability for promotion. \\nThe training should be generally on the same lines as in itial training, but the period may be curtailed \\nsince the employee would already have a certain amount of background knowledge on account of \\nhis experience.  \\n \\nParticular attention should be paid to the older men, who although very proficient in the practic al \\naspects of their work, are unable to pass the prescribed trade tests etc. In regard to the theoretical \\naspects because of their poor educational background. It often happens in consequence that they \\nare blocked from being promoted although they are fit in every other respect. By paying individual \\nattention to such men and teaching them elementary theory, they could be made sufficiently trained \\nto enable their passing the trade tests. This not only ends their frustration, but boosts staff moral as \\na whole .  \\n \\n21205 Refresher Courses  \\n \\n1.  In accordance with extant instructions current on the subject, refresher courses should be \\narranged.  This is obligatory for those categories of staff dealing with “ safety of train operation or \\nhaving daily contact with t he public”. The following is an illustrative list of traction distribution staff \\ncoming with in the scope of these instructions.  \\n \\n-Traction Power Controllers  \\n-Asstt. Traction Power Controllers  \\n-Supervisors of OHE  \\n-OHE Inspection Car Drivers  \\n \\nINDIAN RAI LWAYS - AC TRACTION MAN4JAL VOLUME 11 PART    [2351  -linesmen authorized to take power blocks and permit -to-work  \\n \\n2.   Refresher courses are also desirable for other categories of maintenance staff. The categories \\nof staff for whom refresher courses are to be arranged can be decided by the General Manager in \\naccordance with para 117(a) of the Indian Railway Establishment Manual.  \\n \\n3.   The object of a refresher course is to reinforce and update the knowledge of the staff and bring \\nthem up - to-date in rega rd to the latest rules and procedures and Instructions regarding operation \\nand maintenance in the light of experience gained. The duration of the refresher course for each \\ncategory may be decided by CEE to suit local conditions. The duration for typical ca tegories is given \\nbelow for guidance :  \\n \\na) Supervisors      3 weeks  \\nb) Artisan Staff      2 weeks  \\n \\n4.   For categories of staff liable for inter -divisional transfers, programming of refresher courses \\nshould be arranged by the headquarters office. For st aff confined to a particular division, the \\nprogramming should be done at the divisional level.  \\n \\n5.Apart from rules and regulations, the refresher courses for the operating staff should lay                                                                  \\nemphasis on trouble shooting procedures for various types of euipments. Actual drilling during the \\nrefresher course will be of great benefit. This involves repetition of the same exercise several times \\nso as to make a lasting impression on the staff and sho uld not to be forgotten easily.  \\n \\n6.    For Linesmen and Supervisors of the OHE section the main emphasis during the refresher \\ncourses should be on standards to be obsrved in adjustments of OHE,   safety rules applicable to \\nOHE work and methods of quick re storation of OHE in the event of breakdowns/accidents.  \\n7 .   During refresher courses, it will  be very useful to arrange group discussions amongst the \\ntrainees on specific problems encountered during the course of work. Such group discussions will \\nbe of g reat assistance in view of the opportunity for exchange of information based on actual \\nexperience in working.  \\n21206 Facilities for Training  \\n \\n1.    Facilities have been provided on an All India basis f6r the intensive specialized training of \\nofficers and staff of the Electrical Department. The facilities available should be utilized to best \\nadvantage.  \\n \\n2.   Training schools for OHE staff have also been set up where the specialized techniques of work \\non 25 kV OHE are taught to skilled artisans as well as s upervisors with particular reference to safety \\nrules applicable to OHE work and methods of effecting emergency repairs. For example a cat -walk \\nat a height of about 5 m from ground level is provided, so that a trainee can climb up a post, walk \\nacross the ca t-walk and get rid of the fear of height, he can be taught the methods of protecting \\nhimself by means of ropes and safety belts, the correct method of testing and earthing, the \\ntechnique of erecting a mast, the correct method of using the various specializ ed OHE tools and \\nequipment, the method of splicing various OHE conductors etc.  \\n \\n3.    In a training school, the essential equipment to be provided for instructional purposes should \\ninclude the following:   \\n \\na) Special tools and instruments used in electri c traction.  \\n \\nb) Cut -models to show constructional details of equipment.  \\n \\nc) Circuit diagrams, sectioning diagrams, etc. illuminated and arranged to show the sequence of \\noperations.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME 11 PART 1   [236]  d) Sampl es of  damaged equipment with tablets explaining the nature and causes of failures and \\npreventive cheeks.  \\n \\ne) Publicity boards with slogans and illustrations emphasizing safe methods of working  \\n \\nf) Boards illustrating ‘Do\\'s\\' and \"\\'Don\\'ts\\',  \\n \\ng) Preferably  full working models.  \\n \\n21207 Training in General and Subsidiary Rules  \\n \\nSupervisors, when required, should receive initial training as well as refresher courses in General \\nand Subsidiary Rules norwilly In the Zonal Transportation Schools, which usually ha ve model rooms \\nto facilitate the proper understanding of the rules and systems of working. In exceptional cases \\nwhen such training cannot be arranged conveniently in the Zonal Schools, CEE may authorize the \\ntraining in GRs & SRs to be included in the sylla bus for training in TrD Training Schools. Separate \\nInstructors well versed in the subject should, however, be deputed for imparting the training.  \\n \\n21208 Responsibility of Officers and Supervisors  \\n \\nApart from those in -charge of training schools, other off icers and supervisors in -charge of operation \\nand maintenance should also take a keen personal interest in the trainees of all grades attached to \\nthem. They should deem it as part of their duty to guide the trainees and watch their progress. \\nTraining is a c ontinuous process which helps the officers as much as the trainees not only in \\ndeveloping contacts on a personal level, but also in understanding the finer points of operation and \\nmaintenance. A record of progress achieved, the period of training given etc . should be maintained \\nfor every trainee.  \\n \\n21209 Examination at the End of Training  \\n \\nAll trainees should pass the prescribed examination on completion of training. The scope of \\nexamination and the level of officers and supervisor responsible for examinin g will be laid down by \\nCEE, The examination should have a practical bias.  \\n \\n21210 Specialized Training  \\n \\n1.   Selected staff from different categories should be deputed to work with the Contractor\\'s staff \\nduring OHE,  \\nPSI and Remote Control construction wo rk, so that they become fully proficient in the various operations including erection  final adjustment, testing and commissioning.   \\n2.   Similarly when large contracts are entered into for supply of electric traction equipment \\nincorporating new designs a nd technology, it is usual practice to include in the contract a clause \\nwhich permits some staff of the consignee railways to be deputed to the manufacturer\\'s works \\nduring the production stage for practical training on the equipment, so that they may get t horoughly \\nacquainted with the operation and maintenance of the equipment, taking advantage of the training \\nfacilities available with the contracting firms.  \\n \\n21211 Syllabi  \\n \\nOutline syllabi for OHE Linesman is given below as examples. Syllabi on the same l ines are \\nprepared for all courses of training.  \\n \\n1. OHE Linesman (Initial Training) - Duration: 60 weeks.  \\nA.

In case of curves on the banks of such bridges, the span should be 4.5 m less than the maximum span permitted by relevant span and stagger chart, but should not exceed 54 m for heavy (red) wind pressure zone and 63 M for medium (yellow) pressure zone. \\n \\n6.2 Two Track Cantilever \\n \\nIn the yards and sidings when the mast cannot be erected near the track to be equipped, it may be erected spanning one or two tracks using a two trac k cantilever (Drg. No. ETI/C/009, Sheet 1).  This \\nis generally used for supporting OHE near turnouts and X-overs.  This arrangement should not be \\nused for supporting OHE of two main lines.  The OHE can be supported upto a distance of 10.5 m \\nfrom the upright with this arrangement. \\n \\n6.3 Portals  \\nOn multiple track sections, where adequate track centres are not available and tracks cannot be \\nslewed, portals are used.  Each portal consists of two fabricated uprights and one fabricated boom \\nconsisting of with or without one central piece and two end pieces. \\n 6.3.1 Three types of portals have been standardized. “N “ type portal is used for clear spans of 10 m-20m (4 track maximum), ‘O” type portal is for clear span of 20m-30m( for 6 tracks maximum)  and \\n‘R’ type portal with span of 30m-40m (for 8 tracks maximum). \\n \\n6.3.2 Where the upright of standard portals cannot be erected due to limited track centres, ‘P’ type \\nportal may be used in place of ‘N’ type and ‘G’ type may be used in place of ‘O’ type.  The width of \\nupright of these portals  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS- AC TRACTION MANUAL- VOLUME II  PART  II  [10]  is 300 mm and 250 mm as against 450 mm of ‘N’ type and 550 mm of ‘O’ type respectively.  In \\nexceptional cases, BFB uprights of 152 mm width (Drg. No. ETI/C/0026 Sheet 1) may also be used \\nwith ‘N’ type portal boom.  Special BFB portals with 3 legs (Drg.

However for overlap inter masts and \\nmasts on the inside of curves, 550 mm wide shoulder is necessary ( Drg. No. ETI/C/0023) . (Ref. \\nFig. A1.02). \\n \\n6.5.4   New pure gravity foundations may be used for masts where soil bearing capacity is 5500, 8000 and 11000 Kgf./M\\n2 or where adequate shoulder width as mentioned in para 6.5.3 is not \\navailable.  In such cases, it should be ensured that foundation is not exposed. \\n \\n6.5.5.      Side gravity foundations may be used for masts where soil bearing capacity is 8000 and \\n11000 Kgf./M2, or adequate shoulder width is not available.  No portion of the foundation should be \\nexposed. \\n \\n6.5.6 Pure gravity foundations (type G) are used for independent masts where soil surrounding the \\nfoundations is loose and cannot exert passive pressure on the foundations.  G type foundation have \\nbeen designed for soil bearing capacity of 5500 , 8000 and 11000 Kgf./M2.  Pure gravity foundations \\n(Type P) are used for portals and are designed for soil bearing capacity of 8250 and 11000 Kgf./m2. \\n \\n6.5.7 Foundations in black cotton soil \\n \\n6.5.7.1 The foundation of the black cotton should be done preferably in dry season i.e. from November to May.  Excavations should be avoided as far as possible in case of unexpected rains in dry season also. \\n \\n6.5.7.2 In black cotton soils. WBC and NBC type of fou ndations are used.  Primar ily WBC foundations are to \\nbe adopted where swelling/shrinkage is not expected to take place at the founding level and NBC foundations \\nhave to be provided where swelling/shrinkage is expected to occur. \\n 6.5.7.3 The safe bearing capacity should be determined in accordance with IW: 6403 \\n \\n6.5.7.4 When in doubt regarding classification of BC soil as to dry or wet, it is preferable to make NBC type \\nfoundation. \\n \\n6.5.8 Where foundations are constructed on the slope of banks, the foundations should be so located that \\ngenerally no part of it is exposed.  The top of foundation may then be brought to the desire level (rail level- \\n500 mm) by providing a super block of length and breadth equal to the top dimension of foundations.  The \\nincrease in bending moment due to increased setting distance should be calculated  and the designation of foundation to allow for this BM should be selected.  The arrangement is shown in the Fig. No. A.1.03 \\n \\n6.5.9 The top of foundation should be 50-100 mm above the surrounding ground level.  The length of mast below rail level should be minimum 1850 mm for regulated OHE and 1750 mm for un-regulated OHE.  A 1350 mm embeddment of mast in concrete is necessary.  Concrete cushion of 150 mm below the bottom of mast is \\nalso necessary.  Wherever necessary, these may be achieved by providing a super block of length and width \\nequal to the top dimension of foundation. \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS- AC TRACTION MANUAL- VOLUME II  PART  II    [13]  However portion of existing pure gravity foundations  to Drug.

The minimum height shall be 4.92 m for the broad gauge and 4.02 m for the meter gauge to permit movement of “C” class ODC without physical lifting of wires.  In  case “C” class ODC movement is not required, \\nthe height could be reduced to 4.80 m (BG) .  Height may be further reduced to 4.65 m if rolling \\nstock higher than 4.265 m are not allowed on such lines. ( Ref.

But \\nthe difference between the heights of contact wire at two adjacent supports shall not exceed 20 mm.  \\nIn spans with gradient of contact wire, this difference of 20 mm is measured over and above the \\napproved gradient. \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS- AC TRACTION MANUAL- VOLUME II  PART  II    [14]  \\n   \\n8.0   Stagger \\n \\n8.1  Tangent track  On tangent track, the contact wire is normally giv en a stagger of 200 mm at each support alternately \\non either side of the centre of the track.  This is relaxed in special cases for ensuring requisite \\nclearances in difficult locations such as in the vi cinity of signals, subject to stagger at midspan not \\nexceeding the permissible values given in Drug. No. ETI/OHE/G/00202. \\n 8.2   On tangent track, the catenary stagger is zero for masts supporting a single equipment.  The \\ncatenary is fixed vertically over the contact wire at all supports at which more than one equipment is \\nsupported, at flexible head spans and at supports with reduced encumbrance, on tangent as well as \\ncurved tracks. \\n 8.3 Curved track  \\nOn curves, the stagger of the contact wire at supports should not exceed 300 mm.  The stagger of \\nthe catenary on curved track shall be determined with reference to Drug. No. ETI/OHE/G/00202.  \\nThe standard values adopted are 0, +200 and – 200 \\n \\nNote:  For maximum permissible stagger refer para 4 of Chapter V-A of Schedule I, BG Metric \\nSchedules of Dimensions – 1973. \\n \\n8.4   Turnouts and diamond crossing \\n \\nAt turnouts, the stagger of the contact wire on the main running line shall be in accordance with \\nDrug. No. ETI/OHE/G/00202.  The stagger of contact wire of the branching line shall not exceed 300 mm at any point in the span.  This is achieved by selecting a suitable location for the mast near the \\ncentre of the turnout in the case of overlap ty pe equipment, or by suitably adjusting the point of \\ncrossing of the two contact wires in the case of crossing type equipment. \\n \\n8.5    Un-insulated overlaps \\n \\nAt un-insulated overlaps, the stagger should confirm to Drug.

A cross over is equipped in the same \\nmanner as two ordinary turnouts.  Note: Overlap type overhead equipment at turn outs taking off from main line shall be provided. \\n \\n17.2.1 A diamond crossing with or without slips is  equipped as two turnouts, the turnout centres \\nbeing coincident.  The mast located near the common centre is, therefore, equipped with three \\nbracket assemblies (See Drug. No. ETI/OHE/G/02151).  17.3  Crossed type \\nThe  crossed type equipment for turnouts is normally adopted on secondary tracks but may be used \\non main tracks, where speeds are less than 100 km/h.  The overhead equipment of the secondary \\ntrack normally crosses the overhead equipment of the main track or does not have any overlapping \\nspan before anchorage.  The two contact wires are clamped together to prevent relative vertical \\ndisplacement.  For this type of equipment, no support is necessary near the centre of turnout. \\n \\n17.3.1 In case of diamond crossings with double sl ips, if crossed type of equipment is provided, \\ndoubling of contact wire is necessary (See Drug.

In case of curve track when the rail level is raised or the super elevation is changed due to \\nstrengthening of track structure, the pantograph axis will be shifted.  If this shift is not within the possible adjustment limit of bracket assembly as  specified in Clause 19.3.1 and 19.3.2 above, new \\ncantilever may have to be provided taking care that at no stage the contact wire is beyond the \\nspecified stagger. \\n \\n19.4 Size of tubes \\n \\nThe size of stay tube and register arm tube is 28.4/33/7 mm dia.

No. ETI/OHE/G/00158 sheet 1,2 and 3 and  \\n00159 sheet 1,2 & 3).  19.5 Back to back arrangement \\n \\nMore than one cantilevers (on the same side) are provided on the masts for overlap, turnouts, cross \\nover and diamond crossings.  The cantilever may be symmetrical (50 cm on either side of the mast) or asymmetrical (65 cm on one side and 35 cm on the other side of the mast). \\n \\nNote I)  Adoption of more than three bracket assembly is not possible on a single cross arm. \\n \\nII) Cantilever assemblies can be provided on both sides of the masts, if the OHE of the two \\ntracks are of the same elementary section.  This is called ‘Umbrella’ construction. \\n 19.6 Bracket assembly on drop-arm. \\n \\nOn portals, bracket assembly for the intermediate track/s is erected on drop arms.  Wherever the \\ntrack centre is inadequate (i.e. suspension distance less than 1.60 m), the equipment should be \\nsupported on drop arm of reduced length so that t he bracket assembly does not infringe with the \\nswept zone of pantographs.  The arrangement is shown in Drug.

SINGLE PHASE \\nTRACTION SYSTEM \\n                    (This is a reproduction of RDSO’s Code No. ETI/OHE/7(11/90) \\n \\n1.0 Scope  \\n \\nThis code shall apply to 25 kV a.c. 50 Hz. single phase traction system and covers the requirements for bonding and earthing of overhead equipment masts, structures and associated rails of railway track.  The bonding and earthing at traction sub-st ation including feeding posts, switching stations, \\nbooster transformer stations, 25 KV/240 V auxiliary transformer stations and switching gantry as \\nwell as Signalling and telecommunication equipments are beyond the scope of this CODE. \\n \\n2.0 Definitions \\nThe following terms wherever appearing in this Code shall ,unless excluded by or repugnant to the \\ncontext, have the meaning attributed there to and apply as follows: \\n \\n2.1 Bond’ means an electrical connection betw een two or more conductors of non-current \\ncarrying metallic parts of traction masts or structures or supports and rails.  \\n2.2 “Cross bond” means a bond between two rails of a track or two rails of adjacent tracks.  It is \\nalso called a transverse bond. \\n 2.3 “Earth wire” means a conductor run on trac tion masts or structures or supports and bonded \\nto their metallic parts/supports and connected to earth. \\n \\n2.4 “Earth” means a connection to the general ma ss of earth by means of an earth electrode.  \\nAn object is said to be ‘earthed’ when it is electrically connected to an earth electrode, and the \\nobject is said to be ‘solidly earthed’ when it is electrically connected to an earth electrode without \\nintentional addition of resistance or impedance in the earth connection.  The resistance of the earth electrode shall not exceed 10-Ohm. \\n \\n2.5 “ Earth electrode” means a metal plate or pipe  or any other conductor electrically connected \\nto the general mass of the earth. \\n 2.6 “Impedance-bond” is a bond, installed by the Signal and Telecommunication Department, \\nwhich provides a low impedance path for the tracti on return current and a relatively high impedance \\npath for track circuit current. \\n \\n2.7 “ Rail-bond” means an electrical connection across a rail joint between consecutive lengths \\nof rails.  It is also called a ‘Longitudinal bond’.  \\n2.8 “ Rail length” means a continuous length of rail with or without welded joints but with no fish \\nplate joints.  \\n \\n2.9 “Structure bond” means a bond connecting for non current carrying metallic parts of a traction mast or structure or support to the traction rail.  \\n2.10 “Signal bond” means an electric al connection across a rail joint, provided by the Signalling & \\nTelecommunication Department, to facilitate flow of track circuit current. \\n \\n2.11 “Short direct connection” means a connection for electrical continuity, which shall be of the \\nshortest possible length with minimum bends. \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL II PART II            [51] 2.12 “Traction Rail” means a non-track-circuited rail  of a wired track, not required for signalling \\npurposes and which may be earthed.  In non-track-ci rcuited sections, both the rails of wired track \\nare traction rails and in single rail-track-circuited sections, the traction rail is the non-track-circuited \\nrail.  \\n2.13 “Welded bond” means a bond which is made of standard copper conductors with M.S. \\nferrules at either end, pressed on the conductors and bent to shape. \\n \\n2.14 “ Wired track” means a track provided with 25 kV a.c. 50 Hz. Single phase overhead equipment.  \\n3.0 Bonding \\n \\n3.1 In the case of 25 kV a.c. 50 Hz. Single phase traction system, the traction current is drawn from the \\noverhead equipment by the electric rolling stock, operating in a section and passes through the traction rail.  \\nThe return current flows mostly through the earth leaving the traction rail except in a zone extending over a few hundred metres on both sides of the electric rolling stock in operation in the section or in the vicinity of a \\nfeeding station and returns to the traction sub-station.  Bonding of all rails is, therefore, not absolutely \\nessential unlike in the case of d.c. traction where practi cally the whole traction return current flows through the \\nrail and hence bonding of rails is essential.  However bo nding of rail facilitates passage of the traction return \\ncurrent from the earth to the traction rails which are connected to the rail to earth and vice versa and is, \\ntherefore, provided in the vicinity of traction sub-station-feeding posts where the traction return current has to \\nflow back from the earth to the traction rails with are co nnected to the earthed leg of the traction transformer at \\nthe sub-station, through a burried rail opposite the feeding post.  Bonding of rails also ensures the spread of \\nflow of return current into the earth and, therefore, reduces the voltage between rail and earth.  So bonding of \\nrails is done wherever it is essential to keep the rail voltage low to ensure safety of personnel.  \\n3.2 The traction rail of a wired track when bonded or laid on metallic sleepers provides generally an earth \\nbetter than an earthing station with earth electrode.  If, therefore, any non-current carrying part of an equipment or metallic structure is required to be earthed , it shall ordinarily be connected to a traction rail. \\n \\n3.3 Track Circuited Sections  \\n3.3.1 In sections equipped with single rail-track circuits, the traction rail shall be bonded to ensure that: \\ni) The ac voltage drop along its length is reduced so as to minimize the risk of ac voltage being applied to the track relays. \\nii) As low a resistance path as possible is provided both for traction return as well as signalling \\ncurrents as fish plate joints cannot be relied upon for low resistance. \\n \\n3.3.2 In sections with double rail-track-circuits, both rails are longitudinally bonded to ensure a low \\nresistance path for traction return and signalling currents; and also to distribute the return current more evenly in both the rails.  Impedance bonds are installed at insulated joints to provide a continuous path to the traction return current.  Al track-circuited-rails are, in addition, provided with signal bonds. \\n \\n3.4 Structure bond  \\nAll non-current carrying metallic parts of traction masts or structures or supports or metallic parts of \\nconcrete/wooden masts, supporting the traction overhead equipment shall be connected by means of a structure-bond to the nearest traction rail or to an earth wire run on the traction masts/structures/supports or to an earth.  In the case of a portal structure, only one leg of the portal shall be provided with the structure bond, \\nwhereas for head span masts, each mast of the head span shall be bonded to the traction rail nearest to it. \\n Where traction masts or structures or supports are located on railway platforms and are bonded to the nearest \\ntraction rail, a cross bond shall be provided at the location of the structure-bond to connect the rail to the \\nadjacent traction rail.   \\n \\n  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL II PART II            [52] 3.5 Track Bonding \\nIn station yards or elsewhere, where a track is not wired for its entire length, it shall be deemed to \\nbe wired for a distance of upto 50 metres beyond the traction mast at which the overhead \\nequipment has been terminated.  Rail bond and one cr oss bond shall be provided for a distance of \\nupto 50metres beyond the last traction mast. \\n \\n3.6 Mode of Connection of  Bond \\n \\n3.6.1 All types of bond i.e. rail-bond, cross-bond and structure-bond shall be of mild steel of not less than 200 mm2 cross sectional area.  \\n3.6.2 A structure-bond shall be rigidly connected by means of galvanised steel fasteners to the \\ntraction rail and the metallic part of tr action mast or structure or support. \\n \\n3.6.3 A rail-bond shall be rigidly connected by m eans of galvanized steel fasteners longitudinally \\nacross the fish plate joint of the traction rail and the track-circuited-rail in a track circuited section \\nexcept at the insulated joint of the track circuited rail. \\n \\n3.6.4  A cross-bond shall be rigidly connected by means of galvanized steel fasteners between \\ntwo traction rails of a track or non-track circuited rails of an adjacent track.  \\n3.6.5 Where it is not possible to provide a rail-bond a welded bond shall be used.  The bond shall \\nbe connected to the rails by electric or gas welding. \\n 3.6.6 The bond for connecting return conductor to the traction rail through the buried rail shall \\nnormally be made with GI nuts and bolts with spring washer and check nuts. \\n \\n3.6.7 The cross section of an earth wire used for bonding traction masts or structures or supports \\nor the metallic parts supporting the traction overhead equipment in a tunnel or in double rail-track-\\ncircuited section shall be not less than 50 mm2 copper equivalent.  3.7 Bonding in Single Rail-Track-Circuited Sections \\n \\n3.7.1 The traction rail in a single rail-track-circuited section shall be provided with rail bonds not \\nonly over the entire length upto which the track circuited rail exists but also for a distance of 50 m on \\nboth sides of the track circuited length.  In addition, the traction rail shall be cross bonded to the traction rails.  If any, of adjacent tracks wherever they exist at intervals of not less than 100m.  The \\ntraction rails of such adjacent tracks shall also be  provided with rail-bonds over the entire length of \\nthe track circuits and for further 50 m on both sides.  In  case the length of a track circuited rail is not \\nmore than 350 m, a cross bond shall be provided between the rails of the track immediately outside \\nthe track circuited length at both of its end. \\n 3.7.2 In single line section, whether or not doubling of the section is foreseen in the future, \\nprovided with single rail-track-circuit, the non-track- circuited rail shall be provided with rail-bond over \\nthe entire length and for a further 50 metres on both sides.  It shall also be connected to an earth at \\ndistances not exceeding 100 metres from each ot her.  The connections of the non-track-circuited \\nrail to each of the earths shall be made by two separate mild steel strips/flats each of cross section not less than 200 mm2.  The need for providing an earth wire is thus obviated. 3.8 Bonding in Double Rail-Track-Circuited Sections. \\nIn a double rail-track-circuited section, both the rails shall be provided with rail-bonds.  At insulated \\njoints of the double rail-track-circuit an impedance bond shall be provided.  Since no traction rail is \\navailable for structure bonding, an earth wire shall be run on the traction mast or structure or \\nsupport.  In case, the length of the earth wire exceeds 1000 metres it shall be made electrically  \\ndiscontinuous by providing a cut-in-insulator so that no \\n. \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL II PART II            [53]  \\nsection of the earth wire is greater than 1000 metres electrically.  Each such section of the earth wire shall be \\nconnected to an earth at two traction masts or structures or supports at a distance not  exceeding 500 m  \\napart \\n No cross bond shall be provided between the rails of the same track or between the rails of different tracks in \\na double rail-track-circuited section. \\n 3.9 Bonding Adjacent to Traction Sub Station/Feeding Post \\n \\n3.9.1 Commencing opposite to a traction sub-station/feeding post, all the traction rails shall be provided with rail-bonds for a distance of 1000 metres on either side of the traction sub-station/feeding post.

In non -track circuited sections, both the rails of a wired \\ntrack are traction rails and in single rail circuited se ction, the traction rail is the non -track \\ncircuited rail.  \\n \\n2.11   Touch Voltage  ( E touch):  The potential difference between a grounded metallic structure \\nand a point on the earth’s surface separated by a distance equal to the normal maximum \\nhorizontal reach of a person, approximately one metre.  \\n \\n3. Object of Earthing  \\n \\nThe object of an earthing system is to provide as nearly as possible a surface under and around a \\nstation which shall be at a uniform potential and as nearly zero or absolute earth potential as \\npossible.  The purpose is to ensure that generally all parts of the equipment, other than live parts \\nare at earth potential and that attending personnel are at earth potential at all times.  Also by \\nproviding such an earth surface of uniform potential under and surrounding the station, there can \\nexist no difference of potential in a short distance big enough to shock or injure an attendant when \\nshort circuits or other abnormal occurrences take place.  The primary requirements of a good \\nearthing system are:  \\n \\ni)  It should stabilize circuit potentials with respect to ground and limit the overall potential rise  \\ni) It should protect men and materials from injury or damage due to over voltage.  \\n \\niii    It should provide low impedance path to fault current to ensure pro mpt and consistent \\noperation of protective devices during ground faults.  \\n \\nii) It should keep the maximum voltage gradient along the surface inside and around the \\nsubstation within safe limits during earth faults.  \\n \\n4. Governing Specifications  \\n \\nAssistance has been taken from the following standards/codes of practices in the preparation of this \\ncode of practice.  \\n \\ni)   IS : 3043 – 1987                           Code of Practice for Earthing (first revision)  \\n \\nii)  Indian Electricity Rules                1956 (latest ed ition)  \\n \\niii)  National Electrical Code              1985 of Bureau of Indian Standards  \\n \\niii) IEEE Guide for safety in a.c. substation grounding.

Earth Electrodes  \\n6.1 The earth electrode shall normally be of mild steel galvanized perforated pipe of not less than 40  \\nmm nominal bore of about 4 m length provided with a spike at one end and welded lug suitable \\nfor taking directly MS flat of required size at the other end.  The pipe shall be embedded as far \\nas possible vertically into the ground, except when hard rock is  encountered, where it may be \\nburied inclined to the vertical, the inclination being limited to 30 degree from the vertical.  The \\nconnection of MS flat to each electrode shall be made through MS links by bolted joints to \\nenable isolation of the electrode f or testing purposes.  A sketch for typical arrangement of an \\nearth electrode is shown in Figure 3.01.  \\n6.2 Earth electrodes shall be embedded as far apart as possible from each other.  Mutual \\nseparation between them shall usually be not less than 6.0 m (which i s twice the length of the \\nelectrode).  \\n \\n6.3 If the value of earth resistance specified in clause 5 can not be achieved with a reasonable \\nnumber of electrodes connected in parallel such as in rocky soil of high resistivity, the earth \\nsurrounding the electrodes s hall be chemically treated.  The earth electrode shall be surrounded \\nin an earth -pit by alternate layers of finely divided coke, crushed coal or charcoal and salt atleast \\n150 mm all round.  Though substantial reduction in earth resistance can be achieved b y coke \\ntreated electrode, yet as this method results in rapid corrosion not only of electrode but also of \\nsteel frame work to which it is bonded, coke treatment shall be used only where absolutely \\nnecessary and such electrodes shall not be situated within 6.0 m of other metal work.  \\n \\n6.4 IN high embankments, it may be difficult to achieve earth resistance specified in clause 5 even \\nafter chemical treatment of electrodes.  In those locations, use of electrodes longer than 4 m so \\nas to reach the parent soil is rec ommended.  \\n \\n6.5   As far as possible, earth electrodes for traction substations/switching stations shall be installed \\nwithin and adjacent to perimeter fence.  At large sites, apart from securing a sufficiently low \\nresistance and adequate current carrying capaci ty a reasonable distribution of electrodes is also \\nnecessary.  \\n \\n7.

The connection between the earth electrode and the grid shall be by \\nmeans of two separate and distinct connections made with 75 mm x 8 mm MS flat.  The \\nconnection between the MS flat and t he MS rod shall be made by welding, while that \\nbetween the earth electrode and the MS flats through MS links by bolted joints.  The earth \\nelectrodes shall be provided at the outer periphery of the grid as shown in Fig. 2  As far as \\npossible the earthing  g rid conductors shall not pass through the foundation block of the \\nequipments.  All crossings between longitudinal conductors and transverse conductors shall \\nbe jointed by welding.  The transverse and longitudinal conductors of the earthing grid shall \\nbe su itably spaced so as to keep the step and touch potentials within acceptable limits; the \\noverall length of the earthing grid conductors shall not be less than the calculated length \\n(refer Annexure -I)  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOL II PART II      [59]  \\n 7.1.2  The size of the earthing grid conductor shall be decided based on the incoming system \\nvoltage and fault level (refer Annexure).

Ratio)  \\n \\na) Assuming an overload of 50% of the traction transformer and that the entire current is fed through one \\nfeeder circuit breaker, critical impedance setting of the relay (to allow line operation at maximum loads) is \\ncalculated from the following relation:  \\n \\nCritical impedance   setting           = 24,000V             CT Ratio  \\n               -------------                -------------  \\n              1.5x rated full load   PT ratio  \\n                 curr ent of transformer     \\n                in Ampere x cos ( theeta -fyi  ) \\n \\nWhere       Theeta=                           maximum torque angle of relay  \\n                      \\n                               Fyi    =                         Load angle may be take n as 40 degree  \\n \\nSay, critical impedance setting is Z.  For the relay not to operate under the said overload conditions, the \\nimpedance setting of the relay must be lower than Z.  \\n \\nb) The impedance setting of  the Mho relay should be a minimum of Y and a maximum  of X.  The setting \\nshould also not exceed Z.  In other words, when the value of Z lies between X & Y, the relay may be set to \\nZ.  If Z is higher than Z,. then the relay may be set to Z.  If Z is less than Y, then the relay should be set to \\nY and it should  be understood that the assumed overload will not be permitted by the relay.  Note that the \\nvalues X, Y and Z are calculated along the maximum torque angle line of the relay.  \\n \\niii. The relay settings may be calculated  by following the procedure given at (I) or  (ii) above for the two \\nsides of the feeding post separately.  However, the distance protection relays of both the feeders \\nshould be set to higher of the two calculated values.  This is to ensure that when one feeder breaker \\nis taken out for maintenance, t he relay should be able to see the faults on either side of feeding post.  \\n \\n2.2 Instantaneous over -current protection  \\n \\nThis relay provides primary protection to the catenary on earth faults in the vicinity of the feeding post.  The \\ncurrent setting of the relay may correspond to about 200% of the continuous current rating of the traction \\ntransformer.  Assuming that a factor of 1.25 will account for the CT and relay errors and relay transient over \\nreach, the relay will allow loads of about 200/1.25 i.e. 160% of th e rated load current.  \\n23. Wrong Phase coupling protection using offset MHO type  \\nYCG 14( English – Electric Make)  \\nThe impedance setting of the English – Electric make YCG -14 relay is given by K 1 K 2 (K3 + K4  ), where K 1  & \\nK2   are plug board settings and K  & KK  are potentinmeter setting ( Refer  Relay Catalogue).  The maximum \\ntorque angle of the relay is 125 and forward off set is about 10% of K  K  ..  The WPC relay at that substation \\nwhere the 25 kV voltage is lagging with respect to the voltage at the su bstation with which it has been wrongly \\ncoupled will operate.  \\nThe impedance setting of the WPC relays at TSS – 1 may be determined graphically following the procedure  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL         [100]    \\n h. impedance settings of wrong phase coupling relay for two sides of the TSS -1 may be calculated \\nindividually following the above procedure.  The higher of the two values may be adopted for both the \\nWPC relays at TSS -1.\\\\ \\n \\n1.  Traction sub -station Transformer protection:  \\nLow Voltage side ( 25 kV side)  \\n \\n1. Restricted earth fault relay  \\n \\nThe current setting of this relay may correspond to 10% of the rated current of traction power transformer.   \\n \\nii. IDMT over current relay  \\n \\nThe function of this relay is t o act as back up protection to the feeder protection relays.  The reach of the relay \\nshould be as much as possible.  However, to permit overloading of the traction power transformer of the \\ntraction substation, the current setting of the relay may be select ed to correspond to 150% of the rated current \\nof the traction power transformer.  \\n \\nThe time -multiplier setting of the IDMT relay may be selected such that the relay operation time is 0.4 to 0.5 \\nsec. For an earth fault on the 25 kV bus.  \\n \\n1.2 High Voltage side ( 220KV/132KV/110KV/66KV side)  \\n \\nI. Restricted earth fault relay  \\n \\nThe current setting of the relay may correspond to 10% of the rated current of traction power transformer.  \\n \\nii. IDMT over current relay with instantaneous over current element  \\n \\nThe instantaneous eleme nt may be set to correspond to a current of 1.25 times the fault current, for an earth \\nfault on the 25 kV bus at the traction substation.  The purpose of such setting is to avoid operation of this relay \\nfor 25 kV bus faults at the traction substation.  \\n \\nThe current setting of the IDMT relay may be such that it has maximum reach but permits overloading of \\ntraction transformer.   The setting may, therefore, be selected to correspond to 150% of the rated current of \\ntraction power transformer.  To have time grad ing with the IDMT relay on the 25 kV side, the time multiplier \\nsetting may be selected such that the relay operating time is 0.8 to 0.9 sec. For earth fault on the 25 kV bus at \\nthe traction sub -station.  \\n \\niii. Biased differential relay (type DDT)  \\n \\nThe three sett ings of the relay may be selected as follows:  \\n \\na) The percentage bias setting should be so chosen that the relay remains inoperative on differential \\ncurrents resulting from (1) tap changing on traction transformer, (2) mismatch in CT ratios and (3) \\ndifference  in CT saturation levels under through -fault conditions.  Percentage mismatch resulting from \\nfactors (1) and (2) may be calculated from actual data and an allowance of 7.5 to 15% may be made for \\nfactor (3).  \\n \\nb) The operating current setting may be taken as 40 %.  If mal -operations of the relay are observed on \\nthrough faults and magnetizing inrush (switching in of power transformer), a higher setting may be \\nconsidered.  \\n \\nc) The time multiplier setting may be taken as 1.  If mal -operations of the relay are noted on m agnetizing in \\nrush but not on through faults, then the time multiplier setting may be increased.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL –VOL II PART II     [103]  \\n                               APPENDIX    VII  \\n \\nGENERAL GUIDELINES FOR ANTI -THEFT CHARGING OF OHE  \\n \\n1. General  \\n1.1 In the theft prone area the energisation of OHE at 2.2 kV as an anti -theft measure may be done \\nto avoid theft of contact/catenary wire.  As energisation at 2.2 kV is purely for the  purpose of \\narresting the theft of catenary and contact wire and not for train operation, it is not likely to \\nproduce any inductive interference affecting signalling and telecom. Installations due to \\npractically no current flowing in the circuit.  Therefor e, even though certain works like erection of \\nisolators and section insulators, installation of SWS, BTs,. Ats adjustment of OHE, SED checks, \\ntower wagons checks, provision of CLS, Telecom, cabling etc. are not completed in all respects, \\nOHE can be charged  at 2.2 kV.  \\n \\n1.2 Period of anti -theft energisation will be restricted at night hours only i.e. from 7 PM to 7 AM.  \\n \\n   2.0 Works to be completed prior to 2.2 kV Energisation  \\n2.1The following works are essentially required to be completed prior to 2.2 kV anti -theft \\nenergisation of OHE.  \\n \\n2.1.1  Stringing of catenary and contact wire complete with droppering, clipping, and insulation and \\nprovision of automatic tensioning device.  \\n \\n2.1.2  Provision of structure bonds in open route and structure and rail bonding in station a reas in \\naccordance with the Bonding and Earthing code.  In station areas where Bonding and Earthing work  \\nhas not been completed, the return conductor (RC), if provided, may be used as earth wire and \\nconnected solidly to the OHE structures/supports by mean s of suitable jumpers.  At both the ends of \\nthe station, RC shall be connected to rails.  \\n \\n2.1.3  All necessary LT modification works  \\n \\n2.1.4  Necessary modification to all HT crossings to meet atleast the requirements \\nfor 2.2 kV as per the standards laid down in Appendix  IV. \\n \\n2.1.5  Provision of wire mesh screen on the working platform of existing semaphore \\nsignals in case the requisite electrical working clearance of 2 m is not \\navailable.

Engineering, signalling etc. within two metres of OHE, the energised OHE will have to be switched off.  \\nAll these works can be carried out  only when the “permit to work” has been given by the authorised \\nrepresentative of RE.  \\n \\n5.2 Calculation of ‘Permit to work’ and recharging of OHE:  After the work has been finished by the party \\nrequiring ‘ permit to work’ the party will give back in writing to  the authorised representative of RE at site, \\nwho originally handed over the ‘ permit to work’ to them, that the work in the vicinity of the OHE has been \\ncompleted and there is no objection for the overhead equipment to be energised.  The authorised RE \\nrepresentative will then remove the discharge rods and return the ‘permit to work’ to the Supervisors of \\nRE from whom he has taken in  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL II PART II     [139]   \\nwriting by exchange of private numbers.  The Supervisors  of RE will ensure that all ‘permit to work’ \\ngiven by him, has been suitably returned to him.  After he has ensured this, he shall remove \\ndischarge rods from OHE, and shall then energise the transformer, thus energising the overhead \\nequipment on 2.2. kV ac .  \\n \\n6. Abnormal Operations  \\n \\nAs already stated the OHE will normally be energised on 2.2. KV/ac and treated as live ty every \\nbody and hence the ‘permit to work’ has to be obtained from authorised supervisor of RE for any \\nwork within two metres of OHE.  In case  of any accident/abnormality, or in case of miscreants’ \\nactivity, if the OHE gets earthed and the L.T. fuse of transformer blows off, the same will be \\nindicated in the room of ASM by the sounding of buzzer and also by lighting a red lamp.  In such \\ncase the  ASM should immediately call for the authorised representative of RE posted with him.  He \\nshould also send a message to the supervisor  of RE who will take charge of the situation.  He will \\ndeclare the section faulty after further checking if required.  He  should then, advise the ASM on duty \\nin writing to send necessary information to the section controller for issuing caution orders to the \\nDrivers of all up and down trains of the defective zone.  The supervisor has to then isolate the faulty \\nsection and se nd the patrolling party online.  The patrolling party incharge will take ‘ permit to work’ \\nfrom the supervisor.  The supervisor will not energise the OHE unless and until all the patrolling \\nparties in section return the ‘permit to work’: by exchanging priv ate numbers or in writing.  \\n \\n7. Authorisation of staff  \\n \\nNo body other than the person authorised will carry out Switching operations on OHE and other \\ninstallation, issue, receive and cancel ‘ permit to work’.  Such persons will be authorised only after \\nduly be ing tested by DEE/AEE (RE) and shall not be below the rank of skilled artisan.  \\n \\n8. Special Instructions  \\n \\n8.1 Every Railway employee is required to make himself familiar with the methods of first aid to be \\nrendered in case of Electric shock.  \\n \\n8.2 Proximity of a live c onductor has to be avoided; since the risk of direct contact would occur while \\nworking very close to a live conductor.  \\n \\n8.3 It is important to note that induced voltage may appear at any instant in metallic masses in the \\nvicinity of traction conductors.  \\n \\n8.4 Since  there can be presence of return current in rails, use of Rails as a footpath, a seat or for \\nother purpose is stictly prohibited.  \\n \\n8.5 No persons should go on top of a wagons, Bogie, engine or any other structure, without properly \\nensuring that OHE power suppl y is completely cut -off and the overhead equipment is earthed.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL II PART II     [140]  Annexure A 7.02  \\nRAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION.....  \\nGENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE OF WORKS...  \\n \\nIt is hereby certified that all th e electrification works to be executed by the Railway Electrification \\n.....................   for 2.2 kV single phase anti theft energisation of section from  .......

Joint Procedural orders are issued by Zonal railway laying down guidelines for officers and staff \\nof different disciplines to clearly demarcate role and responsibilities among these discipline .  \\nLikewise circulars are issue d to the all concerned to inform (I) new rules and procedures (ii) \\nchanges in procedures due to some alteration in the system; and at times to reiterate extant \\nrules and procedures.  \\n \\n2. Extract from some of the JPO’s/Circulars issued by Zonal Railways are app ended for illustration \\nand reference.  \\n \\n1. Closing and Securing of Flap Doors of Wagons  \\nInstructions exist that flap doors of the wagons, loaded or empty, should be properly closed and \\nsecured before being taken out from goods sheds, siding in yards and on tra ins.  Many cases have, \\nhowever, been reported when the wagons with open flap and other doors or with doors improperly \\nsecured have created situations fraught with danger.  Several accidents have taken place in the \\nelectrified territories where the OHE mast s were struck by the open doors of the wagons causing \\nserious dislocation of traffic.  Determined steps should be kept to completely arrest such accidents.  \\n \\n2. Prompt and proper closing and securing of wagons doors and bottom hinged as well top hinged \\ndalas m ust be ensured while undertaking the following operations: - \\n \\na) At loading and unloading points  \\n \\ni) After loading and or unloading of wagons in goods shed lines and other railway sidings, the \\ngoods clerk incharge of getting the loading and unloading operations w ill be responsible for \\nensuring that all the doors of the dalas are properly closed and secured on completion of \\nwork.  Services of the train examiner where available will be availed in case of a stiff door or \\ndala.  \\n \\nii) The shunting Jamadar or the traffic  of ficial deputed to draw out wagons from goods shed \\nlines and other sidings will ensure that the doors and dalas are closed and secured before \\nthey start drawing out.  \\n \\niii) Similarly, the incharges of the various departmental siding such as loco sheds, diesel she ds, \\nelectric sheds, stores sidings, engineering sidings etc. will be responsible for closing and \\nsecuring of doors and dalas after loading and unloading of materials, fuels, stores etc.  \\n \\nb) In shunting operations in yards  \\n \\nBefore starting the shunting operati ons in the yards, the shunting Jamadar will ensure that the doors \\nand dalas of all the wagons being pulled are properly closed and secured.  He should call for the \\nassistance of a TXR  in case of a stiff door or dala.  He should observe this while sorting wagons, \\nwhile attaching wagons on trains, while detaching wagons from trains and in all other miscellaneous \\nshunting movements.  \\n \\nc) On train  \\nThe guard incharge of the train will ensure that doors and dalas of all the wagons put on his train \\nare properly close d and secured before he starts his train.  He will point out any lapse in this regard \\nto the Station Master/Yard Supervisors on duty well in time so that the same is rectified without any \\ndetention to the train.  He will observe this while taking charge of  an originating train as well as \\nthrough train taken over from the adjoining railway, adjoining divisions and the adjoining section of \\nthe Division.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLII - PART II     [142]  d) Examination of trains  \\n \\nDuring the course of ex amination of a train, the TXR will ensure that all doors and dalas of the \\nwagons on the train are closed and the stiff doors and dalas are rectified and closed by his own \\nstaff.  The issue of fit certificate for the train should be subject to proper closur e of the wagon doors \\nand dalas.  \\n \\ne) Security staff involvement  \\n \\nThe security arrangements by the RPF staff should be tightened so that no door or dala of any \\nwagon in the yard and sidings is opened by the trespassers.  \\n \\nAny laxity in observance of the above in structions should be seriously viewed and deterrent action \\ntaken against staff at fault.  For this purpose, checks should be organized by officers and \\nsupervisors, particularly the safety officers and inspectors.  Ambush checks should also be \\nundertaken by  Sr. DSO/DSO.  \\n \\n2.Movement of Insulated Consignments on Open Wagons  \\nEscorting consignments loaded on open wagons in electrified areas needs caution against electric \\nshock to escorting personnel.  Approach to any point within two metres of the live parts of traction \\nequipments is strictly forbidden.  \\n \\nCases of accident caused by electric shocks to the personnel escorting insulated consignments \\nloaded on open wagons, insulated from the body of the wagons by rubber tyres or wooden logs, etc. \\nare on record.  To  prevent such accidents the following procedure must be followed.  \\n \\nIn cases where the consignment is kept on insulated supports, like military or civil trucks on rubber \\ntyres, over an open wagon shocks due to induced voltage might be caused.  Induction caus es \\nvoltage of a high order on all metallic consignments while being underneath the traction wires.  If the \\nexposed metallic surfaces of the consignment are in good electrical contact with the body of the \\nwagon, their potential will be same as at the body o f the wagon.  Presence of Insulation between the \\nbody of the consignment and the wagon will result in dangerously high potential difference being set \\nup between the consignment and the wagon which may cause shock to a person on the wagon \\nescorting the cons ignment.  For the movement of such consignments through electrified sections, \\ntherefore, the following precautions are essential.  \\n \\ni) A temporary metallic connection should be made between the body of the consignment and \\nthe wagon.  For the purpose, standard steel wire or size 7/16 SWG (Cross sectional areas \\n14.5 mm 2)  or any other available size higher in cross sections may be used to fasten the \\nmetallic portion(s) of the consignment to the wagon at 4 independent points, without \\ntempering the consignment.  S teel chains of equivalent cross sections can also be used in \\nlieu.  The train examiners of train originating stations will effect and ensure such fastenings \\nprior to issuing fit memos for movement of the consignment.  \\n \\nii) No train shall leave a train originati ng point without the above having been provided.  \\n \\niii) However, prior to entry of such consignments in the electrified sections, the Guard incharge \\nshall check up the provision of such arrangements and ensure onward movement only after \\nconfirming the following:  \\n \\na) The wire fastenings are effected by the TXR staff if available.  \\nb) It item (a) above is not possible, the escorting personnel should be detained from the wagon \\ncarrying such consignments till such time the fastenings are provided for by the TXR – staff or \\nby the nearest traction (OHE) staff as indicated in the working time table.  \\nc) On entry into the electrified section the bonding used will be got checked by the TRD staff.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLII - PART II     [143]  3. Joint Procedure Order for T PCs, Section Controllers, Drivers and Guards of Electric \\nTraction in the event of Hot Axle or other Abnormality in trains, in OHE, in Track etc. \\nnecessitating Switching Off of OHE Supply.  \\n \\nIn the event of Hot axle or other abnormalities in trains, OHE or i n track, joint procedure for \\nswitching off and switching on of OHE in indicated below:  \\n \\n1. In case any hot axle or any abnormality is seen in a running train in block sections or at stations, \\npower supply to OHE of the affected section shall be switched off i mmediately by TPC on duty \\nby opening of the feeder C.B. on advice from Section Controller, Station Master or others as the \\ncase may be under clear exchange of private numbers.  \\n \\nIf the block section is falling in the zone of two feeding posts, then feeder C Bs of both feeding posts \\nmay be switched off and the section isolated must be reduced to sub -sector after finding out the \\ndetails of train by TPC.  \\n \\nRegarding switching off of OHE power.  TPC shall inform the concerned SCNL in writing and \\nSection Controller  shall take immediate necessary action.  \\n \\n2. Station Master and Section Controller should thereafter in consultation with TPC should take \\ndetailed information regarding damages, infringements or any other abnormalities of track. \\nRolling Stock or OHE.  Section Controller should ensure that no train is allowed to enter dead \\nsection on either one direction to avoid snapping of OHE>  \\n \\n3. Look -out caution to driver of the first train of opposite direction which is likely to enter the \\naffected section will be issued by S ection Controller.  After issuing of caution order to the first \\ntrain which is likely to come in the effected section and after ensuring the safe position, TPC will \\nbe asked by Section Controller under clear exchange of private number to charge the particu lar \\nhealthy section which was switched off as a precautionary measure.  \\n \\n4. Joint Procedural Order for TRD, RSO  staff and ASMs in Case of any Abnormality on OHE  \\n1. In case of breakdown of OHE, when it is necessary for a train to proceed cautiously the \\nTFO(OHE) r esponsible for such notification shall arrange for issue of caution order,  An \\nauthorised person shall be present at the site and shall be responsible for showing signals.  \\n \\n2. A caution order detailing the kilometers between which such precaution is necessary , the reason \\nfor taking such precaution and the speed at which a train shall travel, shall be handed to the \\ndriver at the stopping station/other station in such a manner, as prescribed under special \\ninstructions.  \\n \\n3. Showing of Signals  \\n \\nWhenever due to lines being under repair or due to any other obstruction it is necessary to indicate \\nto the Driver that he has to stop or proceed at a restricted speed, the following signals shall be \\nshown and where prescribed and detonators used, it on a double line the direct ion from which trains \\napproach, and if on single line in each direction.  \\n \\na) When the train is required to stop and the restriction is likely to last only for a day or less – \\n \\nA banner flag shall be exhibited at distance of 600 m on the B.G. and the 3 detonat ors shall be \\nplaced, 10 m apart, at a distance of 1200 m on B.G. from the place of obstruction.  In addition, stop \\nhand signal shall be shown at a distance of 30 m from the place of obstruction, at the banner flag \\nand at distance of 45 metres from 3 -detona tors.  The Railway Servant at the place of obstruction \\nshall give proceed hand signal to indicate to the  Driver when he may resume normal speed after \\nthe train has been hand signalled past the place of obstruction.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL II- PART II     [144]  b) When the train is required to stop and the restriction is likely to last for more than a day  \\n \\nA stop indicator shall be exhibited at a distance of 30 m from the place of obstruction and a caution \\nindicator at 1200 metres on the B.G. f rom the place of obstruction.  In addition Termination \\nIndicators shall be provided at the place where a driver may resume normal speed.  \\n \\nc) When the train is not required to stop and the restriction is likely to last only for a day or less  \\n \\nProceed with Caut ion hand signal shall be exhibited again at a distance of 30 m and at a distance of \\natleast 800 m shall be suitably increased by special instructions, where required.  The Railway \\nServant at the place of obstruction shall give proceed hand signal to indica te to the Driver when he \\nmay resume normal speed after the train has been hand signalled past the place of obstruction.  \\n \\nd) When the train is not required to stop and the restriction is likely to last for more than a day  \\n \\nA speed indicator shall be exhibited at a distance of 30 metres from the place of obstruction and \\nagain a Caution indicator at a distance of at least 800 metres shall be suitably increased by special \\ninstruction, where required.  In addition, Termination indicators shall be provided at the pl ace where \\na Driver may resume normal speed.  \\n \\n5. Safety Measures to be Observed in Case of Unusual Occurrences on Electrified Sections . \\n \\n1. In the event of an OHE fault, the Traction Power Controller after segregating and isolating the \\nfaulty section shall also i mmediately switch off the power to the healthy section on the adjacent \\nline/lines over the same route length as the faulty section.  The TPC shall promptly inform the \\nSection controller details of the isolated faulty section (hereafter called the faulty se ction), as \\nwell as the adjacent healthy section (hereafter called the healthy section) temporarily isolated.  \\n \\n2. On receipt of message from TPC the Section Controller shall take all precaution as per the \\nextent rules, treating this section as under emergency power block.  \\n \\na) For the faulty section, the Section Controller shall take all precautions as per extant rules, \\ntreating this section as under Emergency Power Block.  \\n \\nb) For the healthy section, the Section Controller shall take immediate action to inform concer ned \\nStation Masters to arrange issue of caution orders to the driver of the first train due to enter into \\nany of the concerned block sections of the healthy section.  \\n \\nThe caution order shall specify a speed restriction of 25 Km/H by day and 15 Km/h by nigh t with \\ninstructions to stop short of any obstruction or stop at the next station and report condition of the \\ntrack and OHE or any other infringement.  The driver shall advise at the next station whether the \\ntrains following his train should observe any pre cautions or speed restrictions.  \\nAs it will not be possible for caution orders to be issued to Driver of trains already in mid -section of \\nthe concerned block sections, the caution orders shall be issued to drivers only as and when trains \\nare able to reach s tations and are further to proceed through other block sections in the healthy \\nsection .  \\nIn case OHE power supply failure exceeds five minutes and the  Electric Loco Driver for any reason \\nis unable to establish communication with Section Controller through  emergency sockets, the driver \\nshall arrange to check for power supply as laid down in Electric Locomotive Operating Manual and \\non restoration of power, shall arrange to take the train cautiously to the next station, ready to stop in \\ncase of any obstructio ns.  A speed restriction of 25 Km./h by day and 15 Km.h by night shall be \\nobserved for this movement to the next station.  On reaching the next station, the Driver shall \\ncontact SM/Section controller.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLII - PART II     [145]  3. The Section Controller after exchanging message with Station Masters for issue of caution orders to \\nDriver as laid in para 2 (b) above shall immediately authorize TPC to take action to restore Power Supply \\nto the healthy section, unless based on inf ormation received meanwhile from site/stations, it would be \\nnecessary to continue to keep the power off from the healthy section.  \\n \\nIn the event of any obstruction or abnormality online/OHE is reported to the Section controller, directly from \\nstation/site, the Section Controller shall inform TPC to switch off power both on affected line(faulty section) \\nand also on adjacent lines (healthy section) and then proceed as per para 2 above.  This safeguard has been \\nstipulated as all obstructions on line may not nec essarily reflect as an OHE fault giving indication to TPC.  \\n \\nBased on the no -abnormality report of Drivers who have completed their cautions runs through the block \\nsections on the healthy sections, Section Controller shall arrange to remove the caution orde rs to subsequent \\ntrains passing the healthy section.  The Section Controller shall also keep TPC advised regarding resumption \\nof normal traffic on the healthy section.  \\n \\n4. In order to minimize the repercussions to traffic on account of adoption of the above p rocedures, it is very \\nessential that the emergency telephone sockets all along on the electrified line and emergency telephones \\nprovided with drivers/guard are maintained in good fettle.  Joint checks of the Emergency Telephone \\nsockets on the line between TRD and S&T inspectors should be made to ensure their operational \\nreliability in case of emergencies.  \\n \\n6.  Joint Procedural Order for TPC, SCNL, ASMs, Drivers & Guards in Case an Animal is Run Over in \\nElectrified Route.  \\n \\nWhen cattle or animals are run over, v ultures generally assemble on the body nearby the track and \\nsometimes entangle with OHE and/or pantograph causing damage leading to major breakdowns.  \\n \\nWhenever such cases of run over of animals take place or are observed.  \\n \\na) Drivers and Guards will make effo rt to advice the same to the SM/ASMs at the next stoppage for relaying \\nthe same to SCNL/TPC or TLCs.  \\n \\nb) Other railway staff will immediately advice the same to ASMs, SCNLs, TLCs and Engineering Control.  \\n \\nOn receipt of such information the ASM concerned shal l take necessary action to remove the body to a safe \\ndistance to avoid risk of damage to pantographs of passing trains and OHE.  \\n \\n7. Joint Procedural Orders for TPCs and ASMs in case of Electric Shocks with 25 kV OHE supply.  \\n \\n1. TPC shall arrange to cut -off 25 kV  OHE supply of concerned sub -sector and also sub -sector of adjacent \\nline to reduce the effect of induction and shall advise all concerned.  \\n \\n2. TPC shall inform nearest electrical department official and simultaneously arrange an authorised person \\nto come to s pot and move tower wagon/road vehicle from nearest depot if no authorised person is \\navailable near site.  \\n \\n3. TPC shall also inform section controller for regulating the traffic so as to avoid possibility of accidental \\ncharging of the section due to Loco enter ing the section so made dead.  \\n \\n4. TPC shall inform SM/ASM of nearest Railway Station for medical assistance.  \\n \\n5. TPC/SM/ASM shall inform nearest Railway Doctor for Medical assistance with available means of \\ncommunication.  \\n \\n6. TPC/SM/ASM shall inform GRP/RPF staff t o reach site of accident provided RPF/GRP post is located at \\nthe stations.  \\n \\n7. TPC shall advise for movement of medical van if situation warrants.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLII - PART II     [146]  8. On arrival of authorised person on spot, he shall be advised to cordon off the area so that no \\none else may get injured.  \\n \\n9. TPC shall advise authorised person to remove the victim with the help of some insulating rod.  \\n \\n10. TPC shall also advise authorised person to administer artificial respiration and other he lp as \\nneeded.  \\n \\n11. TPC shall arrange quick shifting of victim from site to nearest hospital by  \\n \\na) Stopping first available train  \\nb) Sending Tower wagon or road Venice from nearest OHE depot.  \\nc) Sending ambulance/stretcher  \\n \\n12. TPC shall advise controlling officer about th e accident and take guidance.  \\n \\n13. On arrival of authorised person on spot, TPC must find out the detailed cause of electrical \\naccident and preserve the documents/materials related to it.  \\n \\n14. TPC shall restore 25 kV OHE supply after confirmation from the site by authorised person or \\nSS/ASM on duty that the victim has been dis -associated from the 25 kV OHE.  Authorised \\nperson, after dis -association should give it in writing to the nearest SM.  \\n \\n15. TPC shall collect details about the victim i.e. hospital where admitted,  percentage of burns \\ninjury, his day to day condition and apprise of the position to controlling officer.  \\n \\n16. In case of damage to electrical equipment on this account TPC shall make arrangements to get \\nequipment attended at the earliest to enable restoration  of supply.  \\n \\n17. SM/ASM shall also inform TPC of electrical accident or possibility of accident by exchange of \\nprivate number for making the OHE dead provided SM/ASM is first to get such information.  \\n \\n18. If it is possible to keep the traffic moving by other line, TPC will advise to  Section  Controller in \\nwriting to introduce single line working.  \\n \\n8. Joint Procedure Order Regarding OHE Voltage.  \\n \\nTo take timely action for the problem of low/high OHE voltage, following procedure should be strictly \\nfollowed:  \\n \\ni) The half  h ourly voltage readings recorded by TPCs should be scrutinized by CTPC \\nconcerned daily, in case where voltage of feeding point has gone below 23 kV steps should \\nbe taken to improve the voltage.  The taps of traction transformers should be changed so as \\nto improve the feeding voltage.  If the problem still persists the Supply Authorities should be \\ncontacted.  The concerned Sr. DEEs/DEEs should be informed who will establish contact \\nwith officials of the Supply Authority and get the voltage improved.  \\n \\nNormally  the tap setting of Traction Transformer  at Traction sub -station will be fixed so that daily \\nOHE voltage peaks do not exceed 27.5 kV.  This will ensure that the voltage is well above the \\nminimum of 19 kV at the farthest point of the feeding zone.  \\n \\nii) The cas es of low/high voltages observed by the drivers during the run should be reported to \\nthe concerned TLC before signing off indicating time, voltage observed and location/section \\nwhere abnormal voltage observed.  The abnormal voltage in this case will be abo ve 27.5 kV \\nand below 19 kV  \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLII - PART II     [147]  iii) TLC would also immediately check the reports of other drivers in the same section and advise the \\nconsolidated position regarding abnormal OHE voltage to traction power controller.  The TPC/CTPC \\nwould then take immediate measures as indicated above at para (2).  \\n \\n9. Working Instructions for Permanent Way, Traction and S&T staff for Changing the Rails, Carrying \\nout Track Circuiting and Automatic Signalling Works.  \\n \\n1. Before any a lteration to alignment or level of electrified track is commenced, due notice of 48 hrs. in \\nadvance shall be given to those responsible for the OHE so that OHE may be adjusted to conform to the \\nnew condition (at PQRS site, work will be done under the Joint  Supervision of Permanent way inspector, \\nElectric Chargeman/TRD, and S&T staff continuously).  \\n \\n2. A permit to work must be obtained, if work is to be carried out or any worker is required to come within 2 \\nmetres of the 25 kV live overhead equipment.  \\n \\n3. When unl oading the rails along the track, care shall be taken by PWI/PWM or mate to ensure that the rails \\ndo not touch each other to form a continuous metallic mass of length greater than 300 m.  \\n \\n4. In case of track  renewals, temporary connections shall be provided with the other rail of the track at both \\nends by TRD staff.  In case of renewal of both the rails of track simultaneously, temporary connection \\nshall be provided within rails of adjacent track at both ends by TRD staff.  \\n \\n5. Before fish plates are loosened or removed, temporary electrical connection between the two rails shall \\ninvariably be made.  \\n \\n6. In case of defective or  broken rails bond, a temporary connection shall be made.  \\n \\n7. In case of “rail fracture” the two ends of the fractured rail shall be first tempor arily connected by a \\ntemporary metallic jumper of approved design.  In all cases of discontinuity of rails. The two parts of the \\nrails shall not be touched with bare hands of uninsulated tools.  Gloves of approved quality shall be used.  \\n \\n8. Permanent way staf f shall keep clear of the tracks and avoid contact with the rails either when \\napproaching or reaching the work spot when an electrically hauled train in within 250 m.  \\n \\n9.   In track circuited area, insulated joints shall not be bridged with bare hands or any metallic articles.  \\n \\n10. Use of steel measuring tapes or long metallic wires is prohibited in electrified sections.  \\n \\n11. Before replacing the rails/glued joints in track circuited area the permanent way inspector will ensure that \\ntraction distribution staff and S&T  staff are available at site for removing and replacing the “traction bonds” \\nand jumper/bonding connections where required.  \\n \\nIn each cases, PWI will cancel the block to resume the normal traffic only after ensuring that the traction \\nbonds cable jumpers, bo nd wire etc. have been reconnected by TRD staff and S&T staff, TRD and S&T staff \\nshould be made available at 48 Hr. notice given by PWI for changing rails in case of planned works and on \\nthe same day in case of rail fracture.  \\n \\n12. The Traction Foreman shall se e that all insulating sleeves on traction bonds passing under positive rail of \\ntrack circuits are intact and take prompt action to replace the missing/damaged one.  \\n \\n10. Joint Procedural Order for Ensuring Safety During Track Renewals.  \\n \\nSince the working of rel aying unit involves removal of existing rails alongwith all the different types of traction \\nbonds, it is absolutely essential that temporary jumpers for passenger of return current are provided till such \\ntime the permanent bonds are fixed to the new rails.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAY -AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLII - PART II     [148]  Following procedure shall be followed by the site Incharges of both the Engineering and TRD \\nbranches associated with Relaying work.  \\n \\n1. Before energizing the OHE after completion of work at th e end of each day, temporary \\njumpers/temporary structure bonds shall be provided on the auxiliary rails and the new rail by \\nthe TRD supervisors as per instructions contained in ACTM.  This shall be jointly witnessed by \\nthe PWI in a register provided for th is purpose.  TRD supervision shall keep the register in this \\ncustody.  \\n2. PWI at site should ensure that temporary rail bonds are connected through auxiliary rail before \\nopening/dismantalling of rails joins for replacing the panel.  \\n3. It would be the responsibili ty of the PWI incharge to ensure the safety of the staff once the TRD \\nsupervision has attended to the above work to ensure that temporary bonds jumpers are not \\ndamaged by Engineering staff during the course of working.  \\n \\n4. The length of section of track provi ded with the temporary jumpers shall also be indicated in the \\nabove register at the end of each working day.  \\n \\n5. NO bonds/temporary jumpers shall be opened by the Engineering Branch without first informing \\nthe TRD Supervisors.  \\n \\n6. Formation of auxiliary track sh all also be done in the presence of TRD Supervisor, who shall \\nprovide necessary temporary earthing connection to ensuring safety of staff.  \\n \\n7. At the time of dismantalling/replacing track from the site, PWI concerned will provide continuity \\njumpers as per ins tructions given in ACTM in addition to other instructions for the precautions to \\nbe observed by permanent way staff.  \\n \\n8.

Rules governing the construction, working and maintenance of Private and Assisted sidings \\nare contained in the  chapter XVIII of the Engineering Code.  \\n \\n2. Sharing of Cost  \\n \\n2.1 Private Sidings  \\n \\na) In the case of new sidings where the line / section is electrified, the entire cost of \\nOHE will be borne by the siding owners, as in the case of track. Maintenance cost \\nwill similar ly be borne by the siding owners.  \\n \\nb) In the case of new sidings, where the line is not electrified, the siding owners \\nshall be required to give an undertaking that in the event of electrification of the \\nline within a period of 10 years, they will bear the fu ll charges of electrification of \\nthe siding. Maintenance cost will be borne by the siding owners.  \\n \\nc) With a view to expending the electrification of existing railway sidings, it has been \\ndecided that if financially justified, incentive in the form of sharing  of 50% cost by \\nthe Railway may be agreed to. In such cases, no departmental charges shall be \\nlevied while working out the cost of electrification. The siding agreement shall \\nprovide that electrification assets so created will be property to the Railways a nd \\nmaintained by the Railway at party’s cost. In case the siding owner do not agree \\nto bear their share of cost of OHE, the movement to the siding will have to b e by \\nparty’s own locomotives.  \\n \\n2.2 Assisted sidings  \\n \\na) The cost of retrievable part of the OHE will be borne by the Railways as in the \\ncase of track and the cost of non -retrievable portion will be borne by the siding \\nowner. The interest and maintenance charges will be borne by the siding owner, \\nas in the case of track.  \\n \\nb) In case of new sidings, a provisio n should be made in the siding agreement that \\nin case electrification of the siding becomes necessary in future, as a result of \\nelectrification of the section, the cost of OHE will have to be borne by the party as \\nindicated in para (b) above.  \\n \\nc) In case of e xisting sidings.  \\n \\n(i) With regard to sections which are being electrified, in case OHE for the \\nassisted siding is considered essential, the cost will be borne by the \\nRailways and party’s concerned as para (a) above.  \\n(ii) Where section is already electrified and OHE  is to be provided for the \\nsiding the provision of OHE will be at the cost of the Railways and party \\nconcerned as para (a) above otherwise, movement to the siding will have \\nto be by party’s own locomotives.  \\n(iii) Where sidings has already been electrified effort s, should be made to \\nrecover the cost as in case of para (a) above.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME II   PART II    [241]   \\n \\n \\n  \\nFOREWARD  \\n \\nThe \"A. C. Traction Manual\" containing procedures and practices to be followed uniformly \\nthroughout Indian Railways, was published for the first time in 1972.  \\n \\nConsiderable experience has since been gained in  the operation and maintenance o f electric \\ntraction assets. Technological upgradation has also been continuously taking place. Microprocessor \\nbased SCADA systems for remote control of traction power supply have been introduced with \\ntelemetering facilities. Vacuum and SF6        gas circu it breakers have by and large replaced \\nminimum oil circuit breakers. A pilot project of electrification with 2 x 25 kV State -of-art technology \\non Bilaspur -Bina-Katni section has also been taken up. While earlier supply was being availed at 25 \\nkV from power  supply authorities. Railway owned traction sub -stations and transmission lines have \\ncome up.  \\n \\n.As regards Rolling Stock. 6 -axle WAM4 locos introduced in early 70s have given place to 3900 H. \\nP, WAG5 freight locomotives 5000 H. P. WAG7 locos & WAP 1 /WAP3  locomotives with speed \\npotential of 140 km/h for passenger services, A sizeable fleet of dual brake locos has come up to \\noffer better operational flexibility. Thyristors, electronic slip/creep control using Doppler radar \\nsensors, computerised self -diagnos tic fault indicating systems have also been introduced.  \\n \\nThese developments have given  rise to a need  for updating the Manual. The present Manual caters \\nto this requirement and is the result of developing  efforts put -in by a number of Electrical Engineers  \\nof Indian Railways. I hope the Manual, in  its revised form will help towards better know -how of the \\nprevalent system in respect of Maintenance and  Operation and thereby improve reliability and \\nsafety.  \\n \\n              \\n \\n          (J.

Keeping these changes in mind, the Manual \\nhas been revised and is brought out in three Volumes as indicated below though the style has by \\nand large been retained.  \\n  \\nVolume 1 - General is of a general nature and contains descriptions of the t raction Installations and \\nelectric rolling stock. It indicates the organisation for operating and maintaining the traction \\ninstallations and electric rolling stock, both in the Headquarters and Divisional offices of the Zonal \\nRailways, describing the funct ions at various management levels. It also contains the rules and \\nprocedures for the staff of other disciplines like Signalling and Telecommunication, Civil Engineering \\netc. apart from subjects which all electric traction engineers and supervisors should b e familiar with \\nand therefore this volume would necessarily be an omnibus one.  \\n \\nVolume II - Fixed Installations has been made in two parts. Part 1 covers the operation and \\nmaintenance of traction Installations of fixed Installations as well as procedures for commissioning \\nof new traction Installations while Part 11 contains various guidelines and procedures Issued by the \\nRailway Board and RDSO in connection with fixed traction installations.        -  \\nVolume - III - Electric Rolling Stock is exclusive for the maintenance and operation of electric \\nrolling stock - locomotives and multiple units.  \\n \\nIn the get up of this Manual the paragraphs are numbered with 5 digits. The first digit indicates the \\nVolume number, the next two digits Indicate the Chapter number  and the last two digits the specific \\nparagraph number.  \\n \\nIt will be appreciated that in a Manual of this nature, it will not be feasible to include material to cover \\neach and every contingency that may arise in the course of working of the traction Instal lations and \\nthe electric rolling stock, though efforts have not been spared to make it as comprehensive as \\npossible. In the event of any contingency that might arise requiring supplementing what Is contained \\nIn this Manual so as to suit the conditions on -a particular Railway, the Chief Electrical Engineer of \\nthe Railway may issue necessary Instructions/orders  \\'for the purpose. It would be good practice to \\ncopy such Instructions/orders to other Railways as well for their benefit. However, the provisions in  \\nthis Manual, the Codes,/Manuals issued by various authorities, the General and Subsidiary Rules \\nand any other statutory regulations in  force shall not be contravened.  \\n Any comments or suggestions for improving this Manual as well as any advice in regard  to errors or \\nomissions if any requiring correction may be sent to the Railway Board.  \\n \\nThe making of this revised Manual has been an arduous work and for the efforts put in by a number \\nof senior officers as well as staff of Railway Board, Railways, RDSO/L ucknow and RITES, New \\nDelhi to bring this out, no amount of words of appreciation and. gratitude to them will be adequate \\nfor the purpose.  \\n \\nIt is hoped that the Manual will serve the needs for which it has been made.  \\n \\nNew Delhi  \\n          NOEL LOBO PRAB HU  \\n          Adviser  (Electrical)     \\n \\n \\n  \\nVOLUME III  \\n \\nELICTRIC ROLLING STOCK  \\n \\nLIST OF CHAPTERS  \\nNO.

Hitherto the performance of ac traction motor in locomotive \\nhad always been considered  inferior to its dc counterpart and dc traction was only a compromise \\nsolution to save  on the c ost of OHE.  The use of rectifier on the locomotive  on the other hand \\noffered an alternative of a superior locomotive to a dc locomotive .  Initially water cooled mercury arc  \\nrectifiers known as ignitions, (ignited internally through an ignitting electro de) were used.  Indian \\nRailway purchased two types of locomotives of this type (WAM -1 from Europe &WAM -2 from \\nJapan).  But they gave way to neater and more reliable solution of externally fired air cooled \\nrectifiers i.e. excitrons.  Excitrons had the addit ional advantage of reversibility i.e converting dc back  \\nto ac and could be  utilized for regeneration to a limited extent.  Indian  Railways imported a few \\nlocomoitive of this design  from Europe (WAG -1) and a sizable fleet was assembled and \\nmanufactured at  CLW as well.  A few Japanese locomotives using silicon retifier were also \\nimported (WAG -2) \\n \\n1.2 With the development of High Power Silicon Diode Devices the entire technological \\ndevelopment of ac traction stock took a new turn and more powerful units of ac locomotives were \\nconceived.  The silicon diode is simple  to maintain and is extremely reliable.  At present  bulk of the \\nfleet of Indian Railways consists of such locomotives.  \\n \\n1.3 Both with mercury arc and silicon rectifiers, the voltage control is achieved b y an electro -\\npneumatically operated tap changer. In the locomotives the high tension tap changer has been \\nutilized. Typical power circuit diagrams of WAG -5and WCAM -1 type locomotives are given in Fig. \\n1.01and Fig.1.02.  On  some of the WAG -1 and WAM -2 loco motives, silicon rectifier with tap \\nchanger control has been replaced by  the phase angle controlled thyristor convertor.  \\n \\n1.4 MG locomotives: These locomotives of YAM -1class (Japanese design) are in use in a single \\nisolated section viz.  MAS -Villupuram section .  They employ silicon rectifiers for conversion.  Salient \\ndata on electrtic locomotives is given in Annexure 1.01./A.  \\n \\n1.5 EMU (Electrical Multiple Units) both on MG and BG employ silicon rectifiers for conversion \\nand LT tap changers are used for voltage contr ol.  Salient features of EMU are given in Annexure \\n1.01./B. A typical power circuit  diagram of EMU type WAU -4 is also given in Fig.1.03.  Phase angle \\ncontrolled thyristor convertor has also been deployed on a few 25kVac MG EMUs in place of silicon \\nrectifi er and LT tap changer on Southern Railway.  \\n \\n2.0 Sources of Electric Locos  \\n \\n2.1 Indian  Railways imported 100 WAM -1 Bo -Bo locomotives from Europe, and 36 WAM -2 and 2 \\nWAM -3 Bo -Bo locomotive from Japan.  Subsequent to this, 42B -B high adhesion(mono motor \\nbogies)locomotives designated as WAG -1 were imported from Europe and 45designated as WAG -2 \\nfrom Japan.  Ten WAG -3 locomotive of B -B design of higher rating  were imported  from Europe  \\n \\nManufacture of WAG -1type  of locomotive was taken up in Chittaranjan :locom otive Works (CLW) \\nand later on CLW switched over to the manufacture of WAG -4 type  of locomotives.  After \\ncompletion of 186 WAG -4 locomotives, Indian Railways switched over to 6 axle locomotive  of \\nindigenous design and CLW have manufactured a series of WA M-4 and WAG -5 locomotives.  \\n \\n  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS —AC TRACTION MANUAL —VOLUME III      (3) With a view to improving the performance of the locomotive, WAG -5 locomotives with minor \\nvariations to suit specific application were also manufactured and designated as  WAG -5 with \\ndifferent suffixes.  \\n \\n2.2 Eighteen prototype 6000 HP thyristor control locomotives of 3 type designated as WAG -6A, \\nB&C were imported, six from ASEA and twelve from Hitachi in 1988.  A prototype locomotive of \\n5000 HP capacity with high adhesion bo gies, designated as WAG -7 has been designed and \\nmanufactured by  Chittaranjan Locomotive Works.  A new prototype control is under development.  \\n \\n2.3.To meet the specific requirements of higher speeds for passenger services,CLW manufactured \\nWAP type locomotiv e using Co -Co flexi -coil  bogies to work upto a speed of 130km/h designated as \\nWAP -1.  This loco has been further upgraded for speed potential of 140km/h by providing improved \\nversion of indigenously designed bogies.  This loco is designated as WAP -3.  A f ew WAM -2 \\nlocomotives were fitted with modified drive and designated as WAP -2 locomotive .  \\n \\n2.4 A chart exhibiting the salient features of ac electric locomotive  is enclosed as Annexure 1.01/B \\nsheet No.1&2.  Major dimensions of the various locos are shown i n Annexure 1.02.  Load table  for \\nvarious locomotives are available at Annexure 1.03.  Starting tractive effert is limited to 37.5t due to  \\nlimitation of bridges on Indian Railways.

Mechanical concepts.  \\n \\n3.1 Four axle locomotives had the following types of drives:  \\ni)   WAM1                 : cordon shaft driv e  \\nii)   WAM2 and WAM 3                       :  WN coupled gear drive  \\niii)   WAG(1,3and4)                              :  coupled gear  drive through cordon  \\n                                                                 shaft  monomotor bogie European  \\n                                                                 design and also built at CLW.  \\niv) WAG2                                           :  Monomotor bogie with flexible  \\n                                                                 rubber coupli ngs (quill drive )  \\n                                                                 arrangement (Japanese Design)  \\n \\n3.2 The monomotor bogie locomotives had a starting tractive effort of just under 32 tonne with motor \\npower of 790HP per axle.  Except for a few WAG 1, WAG 2and WAG 3 class locomotives the bulk  \\nto the series of WAG1 and WAG4 class were manufactured at Chittranjan Locomotive Works till \\nearly seventies.  The performance of these locomotives was also not found to be adequate for  \\nmeeting increase d operating requirements.  \\n \\n3.3 WAM4 andWAG5 locomotives which were indigenously manufactured used Co -Co , trimount  \\nbogies of ALCO design with axle hung nose -suspended traction motors.  Same design of bogie was \\nalso used in dual voltage locomotives (WCAM -I).  In WAG -6A & B locomotives, with a view to have \\na high tractive efforts and high speeds (beyond 160 Km/h), 6 -axle locomotive  having Bo -Bo-Bo \\narrangement was adopted.  WAG -6A locomotives utilises ASEA hollow shaft drive system whereas \\nWAG -6B locomotive uses WN coupling.  In WAG -6 locomotives high adhesion Co -Co bogies using \\nunidirectional motor and secondary  suspension arrangement was adopted.  Indigenous bogies \\nsimilar to those of WAG -6C locomotives will be used in the prototype WAG -7 & 8 locomotives.  \\n \\n3.4 In WAP -1 locomotives, flexicoil bogie modifying the existing WDM -1 (General Motor Design) \\nhas been used.  WAP3 loco utilises an improved version of this  bogie.  \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME III       [4]                 \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\nANNEXURE 1.03  \\nWAP 1  \\nSHEET – 1/13  \\nHAULAGE CAPACITY (WITH OUT 5% ACCELERATION RESERVE ) \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------\\n------------------- | \\n| SERVICE  | GRADE |    TONNES AT km / h (TANGENT TRACK)   \\n   |        |       |          |                        \\n                  |  \\n|--------------- |------------- |--------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------\\n-------------------- | \\n|            |  20 | 40 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |  110 |  120 |  130 |  \\nSTART*  |  \\n|             \\n |     \\n|        |            | ------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------\\n------------------ | \\n|        |  LEVEL  |     ABOVE 1500             |\\n 1235 |  4340  |   \\n|             \\n | \\n|          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------\\n------------------- | \\n|            |  1/500 |   ABOVE 1500              |  1350 |  1100 |  835 \\n| 3070  | \\n|            | ---------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |           |            \\n|  | \\n| PAS SANGER | 1/200 |  ABOVE 1500         | 1460 |  1215 |  1010 |  860   |  715   |  545 \\n| 2115  |           |              |           |                   |          |           |           |           \\n|          |         |   | \\n|             |            |           |          |          |           |           |           |         \\n|  | \\n| SERVICE        | 1/150 |  ABOVE 1500|  1415| 1360  |  1185 |  990   |  830   |  710   |  590   |  450 \\n| 1790  |           |              |            |           |           |        |          |           |          \\n|          |           |         |   | \\n|             |            |           |          |        |          |           |           |           |           |         \\n|  | \\n| ICF              |   1/100|  1120 |  1060|  1000| 965    |  850   |  715   |  600   |  515   | 425   |         \\n| 1370  |           |              |            |           |          |          |        |          |           |           \\n|          |           |         |   | \\n| COACHING    | 1/50   |  540   |  520  |  500  |  490| 430   |           |           |              |           \\n|        |  775 |            \\n|             |            |           |          |          |        |          |           |           |           |           \\n|        |   | \\n| STOCK            |            |           |          |          |        |          |           |           |           |           |         \\n|  | \\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------------------- | \\n \\n• MAXIMUM STARTING T.E. -= 25.0 t \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME III      [14]  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAnnexure 1.04  \\nFunctional description of main circuit of WAG -6A \\n \\n1. General Outline  \\nFig. 1 shows a simpl ified diagram of the main circuit.  The current is taken from the 25 KV 50 Hz \\noverhead line by pantograph and passes through the main circuit breaker to the primary winding of \\nthe main transformer, and then through the grounding transformer (GT) to the car  body.  The \\npurpose of the GT is to ensure that the current going through the car body finally finds its way \\nthrough the wheels and is then earth via the rails.  \\n \\nIn addition to the four traction windings, secondary windings are connected to the auxiliary p ower \\nsystem, hotel load and motor field circuit respectively.  \\n \\nAs can be seen in Fig. 1, the main circuit is divided in two parts, called traction motor modules.  \\nThese are controlled individually, depending on adhesion conditions.  \\n \\n2. Traction motor modules  \\nFig. 2 shows the armature circuit for one motor module.  In the convertors, which are built up from \\nthyristors and diodes, the 50 Hz supply voltage is rectified and fed to the traction motors.  To \\nsmooth the current from the convertors smoothing reactor is  connected in series with each motor.  \\n \\nConnected parallel to each traction winding, the power factor control has the form of three tuned LC -\\nlinks.  \\n \\nBetween the transformer and the convertors, automatically operated module disconnectors (MD) \\nare connected ( Fig.2) which also disconnect the field circuit of the module (Fig. 3)  \\n \\n3. The Convertors.  \\nThe convertors consist of thyristors and diode to allow a path for the free wheeling  current when the \\nthyristors are not fired.  \\n \\nDuring acceleration, one bridge only is  being fired until shortly before it is fully advanced.  Then the \\ntwo bridges are both fired until the first one is fully advanced, after which the second is further \\nadvanced, until it too is fully fired.  This procedure is called “overlapping control”.  \\n \\nPhase angle control of the thyristors will introduce harmonics and because of this, both power factor \\nand psophometric current will vary considerably at different speeds.  In order to minimize the \\ninfluence on the supply network, Power Factor Control equipm ent (PFC) is used.  \\n \\n4. The Motors  \\nThe traction motors are separately excited, bogie suspended dc motors.  Each motor is individually \\nfed from a convertor, consisting of two rectifying bridges.  \\n \\n4.1 The Field Circuit  \\nThe field circuit (Fig 3) feeds the motor fiel d windings, each of which is individually controlled. \\nDuring acceleration from stand still, the field current is kept approximately constant until maximum \\nmotor voltage (or maximum available voltage) is reached.  In order to further increase the speed, \\nfield weakening must take place, which leads to lower tractive effort. At over speed i.e. when slip \\ntends to occur on one axle, the field is weakened, tractive effort of the motor concerned thus \\nlowered, thereby, lowering its armature current and subsequently  decreasing the over speed.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME III      [27]  \\n \\n4.2 The PFC System  \\n  \\nParallel to each of the four of  traction windings of the main transformer, Power Factor Control \\nequipment (PFC) is connected and this has th e form of three tuned LC -1 links, switched in and out \\nby two anti -parallel thyristors as shown in Fig.4. The PFC has two purposes.  One is to be a \\ncapacitive compensation for the otherwise inductive traction circuit, thus raising the power factor.  \\nThe oth er is to filter the harmonics out from the transformer windings, thus further increasing the \\npower factor and, at the same time, the decreasing the psophometric current.  \\n \\nThe two purposes are fulfilled by using tuned LC -links,in this case three links showi ng best filtering \\nperformance at 3rd,5th and 7th harmonics respectively.  The demand for capacitive compensation \\nand filtering performance varies strongly with the speed and with the tractive effort i.e. with the firing \\nangle of the main thyristors and the  current through these.  The PFC is controlled so that each \\nlocomotive will appear as an inductive or a resistive load, seen from the overhead line at the \\npantograph.  When the ac current to the locomotive tends to go capacitive, one or more the PFC \\nmodule s are cut to avoid over compensation.  \\n \\n4.3 Safety monitoring and fault detection  \\n \\nFor safety and monitoring purposes, current transformers and breakers are used (Fig.5).  To curb \\nover voltage, a lightning arrestor (LA) is used, limiting the maximum voltage over  the main \\ntransformer.  The current in all windings of the main transformers and all motor fields (Fig.3) is \\nmonitored continuously, through the use of current transformer (CT).  \\n \\nShould an over current occur on any of the monitoring transformers, the main circuit breaker (MCB) \\nwill open immediately.  The potential transformer (PT) is used for monitoring the supply voltage.  \\nWhen the supply is too high or too low, the MCB is opened.  To enable the driver to immediately \\ndiscover any faults in the locomotive a nd, if possible, reset from the cab, a computerized fault \\nindicating system (FIS) has been incorporated.  This system consists of a microprocessor which \\nsupervises all running conditions.  Together with a display panel in each driver’s cab this gives the \\ndriver all the necessary information during fault conditions and also provides possibility to reset most \\nof the faults from the driver’s cab through a push button.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIndian Railways – AC Traction Manual – volume III        [30]            Annexure 1 .05 \\nFunctional description of main circuit of WAG -6B/WAG -6C \\n \\n1. General Outline  \\n \\nFig.1 shows a simplified diagram of the main circuit.  The current is taken from 25 Kv 50Hz \\noverhead line by pantograph and passes through the main circuit breaker to the primary  winding of \\nthe main transformer and then through the ground brushes to wheels and is then to earth via the \\nrails.  \\nIn addition to the four traction windings, secondary windings for auxiliary power system, hotel load & \\nmotor field circuit have been provided . \\n \\n2. Traction Motor Groups  \\nTraction motor armature circuit is divided into two groups of three traction motors each.  The output \\nfrom convertor is fed to the traction motors through smoothing reactors in series with each traction \\nmotor.  \\n \\nPower factor correct ion LC banks are connected across the traction windings.  \\n \\n3. The Convertors  \\nThe convertors consist of thyristors and diodes to allow path for the free wheeling current when the \\nthyristors are not fired. During acceleration, one bridge only is initially fired untill shortly before it is \\nfully advanced.  Then the second bridge is also fired.  This procedure is called ‘overlapping control’.  \\n \\nPhase angle control of the thyristors will introduce harmonics and because of this, power factor and \\npsophometric current w ill vary considerably at different speeds.  In order to minimise the influence \\non the supply net work , power factor control equipment (PFC) is used.  \\n \\n4. Traction Motors  \\nThe traction motors are compound wound motors having a ratio of approximately 60:40 for t he \\nseparate field strength to series field strength.  Motors are fully suspended in WAG -6B and axle \\nhung, nose -suspended in WAG -6C.  Three motors in parallel are fed from a convertor consisting of \\ntwo sequence control bridges shown in Fig,1  \\n \\n5. The Field Circ uit \\n \\nThe field circuit arrangement is shown in Fig.2.  There is one field convertor for each of the traction \\nmotor groups i.e., three traction motors are fed by one field convertor. During acceleration, the field \\ncurrent is kept proportional to the armature  current until maximum motor voltage reference is \\nreached.  After this the field current is reduced to get a constant power characteristic till the weakest \\nfield strength is reached  \\n \\nThe field convertor also performs the required field current control duri ng rheostatic breaking to get \\nthe desired breaking characteristics.  \\n \\n6. Power Factor Correction System  \\nEach traction group has a power factor correction equipment which consists of two independent LC -\\nlinks which can be switched on/off through thyristors.  The  arrangement in shown in Fig.3.  \\nWhen the primary current of the traction transformer reaches about 100A, the switching thyristors \\nswitch on the PFC unit No.1 of both traction groups to improve the power factor.  If the current \\nincreases to about 150A, the 2nd PFC unit is switched on.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME III      [31]   \\n7.

Description of Circuit  \\n \\nThe supply current is taken from the overhead conductor by the pantograph P, through the air -blast \\ncircuit -breaker ABB and the H.T. bushing and cab le, to the primary winding of the main transformer \\nMT.  The return circuit to the running rails is via an insulated earth cable to the axle earth -brushes \\nfitted on each traction -motor axle -suspension.  Also connected to the high -voltage end of the \\ntransfor mer primary winding are a two pole earthing switch EAS and a lightning arrestor LA.  \\n \\nA primary -overload relay POR with its associated current transformer POCT protect the main \\ntransformer.  The main transformer has two equal secondary winding supplying two  half controlled \\nasymmetrical bridges T1, T2, D1, D2 and T3, T4, D3, D4 the dc outputs of which are connected in \\nseries.  The rectifier bridges supply the four traction motors M1 -M4 which are permanently \\nconnected in series parallel configuration, with the ir fields and compoles arranged in the centre \\n(virtual earth position).  The main smoothing inductor SX is divided into four sections, so that in the \\nevent of a motor fault, a high impedance is in circuit and motor cut -out is simplified.  The output \\nvoltag e of the rectifier is controlled to maintain a constant current in the armatures during \\nacceleration, the current being measured by current monitoring devices CMD1 -2.  Overload \\nprotection is provided by the two current -monitoring devices and two motor -over load relays MOR1 -\\n2. \\n \\nA single twin -circuit linear reversing switch FRS is used.  Motor isolation is provided by the motor \\ncontactors MC1 -4 and the motors can be cut out in pairs.  Wheel slip detection is provided by \\nvoltage -sensitive circuits comprising r esistors WSZ1 -4 and wheel slip relays WSR1 -2. \\n \\nThe power circuit includes four surge -suppression circuits:  \\n \\n1. High frequency surge -suppression capacitors HFSK1 -4 connected between each secondary \\nterminal and earth.  \\n2. Resistor/capacitor snubber -circuits connect ed across each power device in the main \\nbridges.  \\n3. Limiting inductors DX1 -2 for rate -of-rise of current.  \\n4. Main surge suppression networks SSF1 -4, SSZ1 -4,SSK1 -4.  These networks are connected \\nin pairs across each secondary winding; a failure of any component i n these energizes one of the \\nsurge -suppression relays SSR1 -2 \\n \\nThe main rectifier bridges are protected from overload by the secondary -overload -relay circuits \\nSOR, SOCT1 -2 \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME III     [35] \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\nCHAPTER II  \\n \\nMAINTENANCE OF ROLLING STOCK – GENERAL  \\n \\n \\nII.

The necessary documents should \\nbe centralized and kept in the PPO.  \\n \\nVIII. 30208   Materials Management  \\n \\n1. This subject is dealt in detail in volume I.  A few relevant items are being mentioned here.  \\n \\nA. The various components – sub -assemblies and spare parts shall be purchased from the \\noriginal/approved supplier of equipment. Railway may however make out a compendium of \\napproved suppliers for each item/equipment, based on RDSO’s/production unit’s list.  Any \\nvariation from the same shall only be permitted personally by Chief Electrical Engineer.  \\nB. For bringing in new suppliers in the compendium of approved suppliers, CEE may personally \\nauthorise use of untried and unt ested equipment for field trials.  Special care is needed while \\napproving any new make and type of brushes for traction motors.  \\nC. Storage of Rubber Components.  \\n \\nStorage procedure in general for any type of rubber components are given below: - \\n \\ni) Rubber compo nents should be kept away from direct sun light preferably in dark place.  \\nDirect sunlight causes much faster degradation of the rubber components.  \\nii) They should be stored in a cool place as far as practicable, preferably below 300 C. \\niii) The humidity of the sto rage condition should not be such that condensation of moisture \\ntakes place on the surface of the material.  \\niv) In the vicinity of these materials, any loose electrical connections should be avoided, as \\nthese cause production of ozone which adversely affects r ubber.  \\nv) Rubber materials should be stored away from contact with certain materials particularly \\nthose containing copper and manganese which act as poisoning agents, aiding their fast \\ndegradation.        \\nvi) Under no circumstances rubber materials should be stre ssed during storage.  The portions \\nunder stress undergo deformations with permanent set leading to degradation.  The \\nmaterials should be stacked in such a way so that any super -imposed stresses are \\nsubstantially avoided.  \\nvii) Any contact with grease or oil shou ld be avoided as these cause swelling, softening and \\ndeterioration of rubber materials.  \\nviii) French chalk should liberally be applied on the surface of rubber materials.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIndian Railways – AC Traction Manual – volume III        [43] \\n ix) Great care is to be exer cised so that the material is used in the order of  their receipt in the \\nstores.  The rubber material whether under storage or in use continues to deteriorate.  The \\nonly difference is that under service condition, deterioration is much faster.  Every momen t of \\nstoring is at the cost of useful life and prolonged storage of the material may render it \\nunserviceable due to progressive deterioration.  \\n \\nIX. 30209   Demarcation of Responsibility between Sr.DEE (RS), DEE and AEEs  \\n \\nThe DEE / AEE (maintenance) will be resp onsible for day to day activities in the shed including \\nunscheduled attentions and scheduled inspections.  He will be particularly responsible for induction \\nof any new type of stock in the shed and ensure that the maintenance schedule for such stock are \\nfinalized in the shortest possible time.  \\n \\nThe Sr.DEE will in addition concern himself with the broader aspects of work and forward planning \\nsuch as watch -out for organizational shortcomings, indenting and progressing the procurement of \\nforward delivery spare s, maintaining a close watch on the functioning of the PPO and above all \\nexercising vigilant technical control over unusual occurrences, recurring failures and unscheduled \\nbooking of locos to the shed and shall be in close liaison with Sr.DEE(OP).  \\n \\n \\nX. 30210   Job Cards  \\n \\nFor each loco/EMU received in a shed for scheduled or unscheduled attention, the PPO will issue a \\njob card in proforma 2.01 to each section incorporating the following:  \\n \\na) The nature of inspection (IA, IB etc.) Refer to chapters III and IV.  \\n \\nb) Additional items of work to be carried out on the loco/EMU by the section, based on booked \\ndefects, pre -inspection of the loco or planned modification.  \\n \\nc) The time by which the loco/EMU is required to be released.  \\n \\nBased on his own inspection, if the Section Cha rgeman finds that any items in addition to those \\nmentioned by PPO are required to be attended to, he will get such work approved by TF(M) and get \\nthe additional items also entered in the job card by PPO.  The job card will thus contain a complete \\nrecord of  all work done on a loco during its visit to the shed.  When the work is completed, the \\nSection Chargeman will sign the job card indicating the time of completion of the work  and the \\nnames of the workers.  The loco/EMU should be offered by the PPO for fin al inspection by E1only \\nafter job cards from all sections have received back duly signed by the respective Chargeman.  \\n \\nXI. 30211   Shed Facilities  \\n \\nMachinery and plant for Loco Sheds  \\nThe list of machinery and plant recommended for a loco shed to cater for inspe ction, maintenance, \\noverhaul and repairs including IOH of locomotives is indicated here under.  \\nList 1 – General Purpose Machine and Tools  \\nA.

One shed which has th e bulk of the holdings of a particular class of loco / EMU will be \\nnominated by the RDSO, in consultation with the Railway, as the parent shed for that class of \\nloco /EMU.  \\n2. Each Railway will continue to tackle operating and maintenance problems as hitherto , but will \\nalso furnish complete particulars of all problems and failures on each class of loco /EMU to the \\ncorresponding parent shed and RDSO together with the modifications evolved by it and further \\nsuggestions, if any.  \\n3. The nominated parent shed will th en collate all the information in regard to each type of failure, \\nstudy the merits of the different improvements suggested from all angles and submit \\nrecommendations to the CEE of the Railways, giving. full particulars of the most satisfactory \\nimprovements  / modifications after they have been actually tried out in service and found \\nfeasible. When any defect is found to be intractable and expert investigation is necessary, a \\ncomprehensive note on the subject should be prepared and submitted by the parent she d to the \\nHeadquarters Office. CEE will arrange to forward the considered recommendations to RDSO.  \\n4. The recommendations received from the parent Railway will be subjected to a further scrutiny \\nand analysis by the different wings of the RDSO after which fina l instructions regarding the \\nstandard approved method of modification / improvement will be issued to all concerned, giving \\nan identification serial number to each with full details and drawings required for carrying it out.  \\n5. On receipt of the instructions  from RDSO, each user Railway will arrange to carry out the \\nmodifications on priority on locomotives / EMUs until the work is completed in all locomotives/ \\nEMUs. Progress of implementation of the modifications will be regularly sent to CEEs office by \\neach shed and CEEs office in turn will send a quarterly report of progress to RDSO.  \\n \\n30213 Records and Register to be Maintained in LOCO / EMU Sheds  \\n \\nParticulars of some of the basic records to be maintained by sheds are given below:  \\n \\n1 History Book - For ea ch electric locomotive / motor coach, a History Book should be maintained in \\nthe loco / EMU shed by the Planning and Progress Office, (PPO).

Based upon the safety requirements, various checks have been evaluated and already \\nstandardized. Also, based upon investigations into failures inst ructions (SMIs) are issued by RDSO. \\nEven for new type of locomotives, standard equipment like pantographs, circuit breakers etc., \\ncontinue to be used and established maintenance practices for such equipments will, therefore, be \\napplicable.  \\n \\nThe scope of m aintenance work to be followed in each maintenance schedule is arrived at, based \\nupon the following: -  \\n \\ni)  Maintenance Instructions supplied by locomotive manufacturer for a new type of rolling \\nstock. Copies of these manuals will be made available for ref erence by maintenance staff.  \\n \\nii)  Maintenance Instructions that are evolved on zonal railways for standardized equipments.  \\n \\niii) Specific instructions already laid down regarding safety / fire prevention requirements etc. of \\nthe rolling stock.  \\niv) Experience on  the system taking into account environmental conditions in which electric \\nlocomotives are expected to perform satisfactorily like temperature, humidity, dust, etc.  \\n \\nOn the above lines, maintenance schedules for electric rolling stock of different classes  and types \\nalready in service have reached an optimum level. However, there may be necessity for marginal \\nchanges as dictated by further service experience.  \\n \\nAs far as new types of electric locomotives and their sub -assemblies that may be introduced from \\ntime to time, the principles enumerated above are to be followed for arriving at optimum scope of \\nwork consistent with periodicity of prescribed schedules.  \\n \\n30301 Alterations in Maintenance Schedules  \\n \\nPresently individual railways might have made minor a lterations in the schedules based upon their \\nown experience. Considering the wide variations in operating and duty cycles and environments as \\nexperienced in different systems, this would be considered logical. However, the recent trend is to \\nenlarge the fi eld of operation of electric locomotives. Thus today electric locomotives of one system \\nare running in other systems. Thus alterations in schedules based upon local experience would \\nhave to give way to standardization of schedules so that the locomotives o f one system would \\nperform satisfactorily when called upon to operate in other systems.  \\n \\nIn the light of experience and improvements based upon trials of modifications, it may become \\nadvantageous either to reduce the scope of maintenance work or the perio dicity already prescribed \\nand standardized. The following procedure should be adopted for effecting such changes.  \\n \\n1) Those which are connected with safety requirements, a comprehensive proposal indicating \\nthe actual experience of the railways, the benefits that are likely to accrue due to proposed changes \\nand the particular reasons for suggesting the change will be sent to RDSO with the approval of the \\nChief  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME II PART II     [60 \\n] Electrical Engineer. Such  modifications to the maintenance requirements shall only be implemented \\nafter RDSO\\'s approval.  \\n \\nii) Proposals other than item (i) above: A similar procedure must be adopted excepting that the Chief \\nElectrical Engineer may authorise provisionally the intr oduction of the change subject to post-facto \\napproval from RDSO. In case RDSO convey an opinion to the contrary, the original schedule shall \\nbe brought back. The Railways can however continue to pursue the matter with RDSO and if the \\nlatter agrees finally,  adopt the change to the extent agreed upon.  \\n \\n30302 Scheduled Inspections  \\n \\nThe maintenance and overhaul schedules to be followed for AC electric locos are as under: - \\n \\nNature of Inspection/overhaul     Place where to be carried out  \\n \\ni) Trip Inspection, IT      Outstation shed or homing loco shed as  \\n           convenient.  \\nii) Monthly Inspection, IA + 5 days    Homing or nominated Electric Loco \\nShed  \\niii) Two-monthly Inspection, IB + 5days.   Homing Electric Loco Shed  \\niv)        Four monthly  Inspection, IC + 10 days   Homing Electric Loco Shed  \\nv) Annual overhaul, AOH + 15 days.    Homing Electric Loco Shed  \\nvi)  Intermediate overhaul, IOH 300,000 km   Homing Electric Loco Shed or \\nNominated   after POH or first commissioning or 3 years   Workshop.  \\n whichever is earl ier + 1 month.  \\nvii)  Periodical overhaul (POH) 600,000 km after   Workshop nominated for the purpose  \\n  commi - ssioning or last POH or 6 years whichever  \\n is earlier + 3 month.  \\n \\n \\nDetailed Instructions for IT, IA, IB, IC, AOH and IOH and POH will be issued b y CEE for each type \\nand each series of locomotives keeping in view inspection schedules issued by RDSO. The scope \\nof work is broadly covered in Annexure -3.0l.  \\n \\nInspections as detailed above may need revision based on experience accrued on new types of \\nlocomotives. For example with WAG 6A locos the schedules are monthly inspections, 6 monthly \\ninspections, annual inspections and 3 year schedule.  \\n \\n30303 Technical Instructions  \\n \\nA set of the technical instructions relevant to the work of each section should b e made available so \\nthat they may carry out their work correctly. These can be classified under the following heads: -  \\n \\ni) Inspection Books  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill      [61]  ii) Inspection Charts  \\n \\niii) Trouble -shootin g Charts  \\n \\niv) Technical Charts  \\n \\n \\ni) Inspection  Books: These give the scope of work of the various scheduled inspections viz. IT, IA, \\nIB, IC etc. itemizing the works and the order in which they are to be carried out, arranged section -\\nwise. The responsibili ty of each section supervisor is defined.  \\n \\nii) Inspection  Charts: These charts are prepared for each component individually. These cover a \\ncomprehensive list of all the points to be checked, the observations to be made, clearances to be \\nensured, specifyin g the conditions under which such verification should be made and the measuring \\nequipment to be used for the purpose.  \\n \\niii) Trouble -shooting Charts  :Clear instructions should be issued in the form of trouble -shooting \\ncharts for each type of defect, which  detail the checks to be made and the order in which they are to \\nbe made. Before the locomotive is given back to service, a competent supervisor should satisfy \\nhimself regarding the correctness of the investigations and the rectifications made. In trouble \\nshooting, the investigating team quite often discovers a pattern of failure on the basis of which \\nmodifications and improvements to designs may have to be initiated.  \\n \\niv) Technical  Charts: These cover full details of all repairs, major adjustments and ref itting of \\nequipment which are to be carried out. Where such repairs are not possible, the item will have to be \\nreplaced by a new component. In the technical charts the detailed description of the material, the \\ntools to be used and the procedure to be follo wed and the defects to be checked after completion of \\nwork are detailed.  \\n \\nv) The CEE\\'s office will be responsible for ensuring that (a) the instructions received from RDSO are \\nforwarded to the Loco sheds and (b) the superseded instructions are cancelled, withdrawn and \\ndestroyed, preserving one copy only for future reference. Instructions received from RDSO require \\nconstant review and a system of generating feedback information on the implementation of these \\ninstructions will be followed. Any modifications required in RDSO\\'s instructions should be carried out \\nonly after approval from RDSO.  \\n \\nThese instructions require constant review in the light of experience. If any modifications become \\nnecessary, Sr. DEE (RS) may introduce changes provisionally with the a pproval of CEE. Such \\nchanges should, however, be advised to RDSO for scrutiny and final incorporation in the documents \\n(see para 30301).  \\n \\n30304 Engine Fitness Certificate  \\n \\nWhenever a loco for passenger service is issued from a loco shed or outstation dep ot after \\nscheduled inspection or unscheduled repairs, an \"Engine Fitness Certificate\" will be issued, a \\nsample form for which is appended (proforma 3.01 Part A and 3.01 Part B).  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill    [62]    \\nAnnexure - 3.01  \\nINSPECTION OF ELECTRIC LOCOS  \\nA. Trip Inspection (TI)  \\n The trip inspection is mainly required for topping of oils, distilled water in batteries and \\nattention to various minor defects which have been recorded in the log book.

Periodical Overhaul (POH)  \\n1.  The nominated POH workshop should issue a programme for POH of locos at least six \\nmonths in advance giving the individual numbers of locos to be called  in, each month. The homing \\nshed will then send to the workshop a list of the important points to be specially attended to during \\nPOH and the list of modification to be carried out. This will enable the workshop to plan the POH \\nwork and arrange for the pro curement/ shop manufacture of components required.  \\n \\n2.  The loco should be sent on its own power from the homing shed to the workshop under \\nescort and along with its History Book. A complete list of all deficiencies in the loco should be \\nhanded over to t he workshop representative who should jointly check the loco along with the shed \\nrepresentative.  \\n \\n3.  All electrical, mechanical and pneumatic equipment should be taken out of the locomotive \\nand overhauled during POH.All worn out rubber components and be arings should be replaced.  \\n \\n4.

All reservoirs should be cleaned and tested for their safe working.  \\n \\n9.  All approved modifications should invariably be carried out during  POH. Deferment of any \\nitem may be done only with the pers onal approval of CEE controlling the POH shops in concurrence \\nwith the CEE controlling the homing shed and under advice to the homing shed. In addition to all the \\nitems indicated against IOH renewal of liners, bushes, etc. should be done so as to ensure \\nclearances and tolerances mentioned in \\'F\\' with adequate margin for wear in service till the next \\nPOH.  \\n10. In addition to complete LT and HT testing of the locos on completion of POH, individual \\nitems should also be subjected to detailed tests after overhaul a nd repair. Detailed test schedules \\nshould be laid down for each item, for mechanical as well as electrical tests, and standard \\nproformae should be available for recording the test results for each equipment. A typical list of tests \\nto be carried out on equ ipment is given below.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill    (86)  a)  Rotating Machines: Insulation resistance by megger, no load tests, full load tests (except for \\ntraction motors) drop test of armatures, resistance measurement of fie ld coils, temperature rise \\nmeasurement.  \\n \\nc) Transformers: For small transformers in control circuits, ratio test and insulation resistance  \\n            measurement.  \\nFor main transformer, testing of oil for BDV and acidity, insulation resistance measurement, ratio \\ntest of regulating windings and auxiliary windings, induced high voltage tests if any repairs have \\nbeen carried out.  \\n \\nc)  Relays: Measurement of resistance and insulation values for operating coils, pick -up and \\ndrop-off values of voltage/current/ter nperature, time delay where applicable, opening and closing of \\ncontacts.  \\n \\nd)  Contactors: Measurement of pick up and drop -off values for operating coils, check for \\nsimultaneous closing of all phases where applicable, leakages from valves and cylinder in t he case \\nof electro - pneumatic contactors.  \\n \\ne)  Cables: Insulation and continuity test, high voltage tests for rewired panels.  \\nf) Resistors, condensers and reactors: Measurement of insulation resistance and ohmic values \\nof resis - tance / reactance.  \\ng)  Air-blast circuit breaker: Insulation resistance of coil -windings and live parts, minimum pick \\nup voltage for operating coils, opening and closing time for primary and secondary contacts, \\nminimum pressure for locking in sequence of opening and closing of au xiliary contacts.  \\n \\nh)  No-fuse breakers (MCBs) Tests for tripping at rated instantaneous trip value.  \\n \\ni)  Tap-changer: Insulation resistance, BDV and acidity testing of oil, correct functioning with \\nminimum air pressure, correct progression and regression  sequence.  \\n \\nj) Silicon Rectifiers: Forward voltage drop, inverse resistance, HV test for complete assembly, \\nvoltage sharing between diodes, testing of cell -check device.  \\n \\nk)  Compressors and exhausters: Volumetric efficiency and leakage tests.  \\n \\nl)  Speed ometers: Calibration by  comparison with a standard meter.  \\nm)  Meters and Gauges: Calibration with sub -standard instruments.  \\n \\n11.  On completion of POH, the loco should be taken over by a representative of the homing \\nshed after a joint inspection at the workshop. Details of work done and modifications carried out \\nshould be entered in the History Book which should be returned along with the loco.  \\n \\n12  On completion of POH, the loco should be subjected to detailed HT and LT testing and \\nshould be given a sh ort trial run. Loco will be returned working on its own power, and if possible \\nworking as a train, after POH to the Homing Railway.  \\n \\nE.  Rebuilding and Recabling of Locomotive  \\n \\n1. During every alternate POH, depending upon the cable/pneumatic pipe condition,  which will \\nbe advised by Sr. DEE of the Shed, the locomotive will be recabled and repiped. Recabling and \\nreplacement of air and vacuum pipe during the third POH will be an essential item if it could not be \\nreplaced during 2nd POH. The workshop should ther efore plan these works well in time.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME II PART II   [87] 2. During every 4th POH, mechanical components and traction gear may need rehabilitation. \\nSome of the major components will also need replacement. POH shops should plan for such works. \\nOpportunity should be taken to upgrade the parts and use the state of art equipment during such \\nextensive repairs.  \\n \\nF.

All springs should be checked up for any crack and damage. Fre e height and loaded height \\nshould be recorded. Only matched tested springs should be provided in the locomotive bogies.  \\n \\n3. An important part of the maintenance of the locos is the checking, at prescribed intervals, of \\nimportant mechanical clearances and dimensions which have a bearing on safe and efficient \\noperation, to ensure that they are within the prescribed limits. Such measurements should be \\nrecorded suitably either in registers or on printed cards and preserved so as to be readily available \\nfor ref erence in the PPO at all times.

Squaring of bogies.  \\n \\nDue to heavy mechanical stress and impacts suffere d by bogies in service, some of them get out of \\nshape and distorted. During IOH and POH, it is essential to restore the bogies to their correct shape \\nand alignment. To check this, at every major shed and POH shop, a test rig with a substantial \\nfoundation s hould be provided over which the bogie can be placed and the amount of distortion \\nwhich has taken, place accurately measured. By application of adequate pressure at appropriate \\npoints either hydraulically or by other means, frame distortions should be corr ected as required, so \\nas to ensure proper mechanical alignment of all parts assembled over the bogie.  \\n \\n2.  Cracks on Co -Co bogies.  \\n \\nThe bogie shall be thoroughly cleaned as per RDSO\\'s recommendations. The extent of cracks shall \\nbe located by visual inspe ction as well as with magnetic particle/dye -penetrant method. After \\nmarking out the full extent of the cracks, arrest -holes of suitable size of minimum dia. 10 mm shall \\nbe drilled at least 25 mm away from the vicinity of the cracks. The entire cracks shall  be eliminated \\nby opening the affected section right upto the bottom. The removal of defective area shall be done \\nby grinding/arc gouging/chipping. The section thus opened out shall extend into the arrest holes and \\nshall be checked up with the help of dye -penetrant or magnetic particle technique to ensure freedom \\nfrom any other cracks. The welding shall be carried out as per the procedure laid down by RDSO \\nwith the help of specified electrodes. It shall be also ensured that all modifications recommended by \\nRDSO are carried out during POH on the bogies.  \\n \\nH. Axle Roller Bearing  \\n \\nThese bearings are used on electric locomotives using trimount Co -Co bogies. The assembly \\nconsists of two cylindrical axle roller bearings capable of taking radial as well as axial t hrust loads. \\nThe bearing is composed of inner and outer race along with rollers and cages. The cages while \\ncarrying no load keep the rolling elements axially apart and also prevent the latter from failing out \\nwhile handling. The outer ring is slide fit in the axle box housing while the Inner ring is an \\ninterference fit on the axle journal forming part of the axle when in place. The rollers  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME III                                                   [90]  are plai n, straight, solid cylinders and are flat on both ends. These bearings should be maintained \\nas per RDSO Maintenance Instructions No. MPMT -98/81, March 1981.  \\n \\nThe riding properties of these locomotive fitted with Co -Co bogie have been further improved upon  \\nby using axial resilient thrust unit on axle 1, 3, 4 and 6. Axle 2 and 5 are provided with float bearings \\nso as to permit negotiability over sharp curves and turn -outs. This arrangement involves changes in \\nbogie frames and axle boxes.

Annexure 3.02  \\n \\nDual Brake System on Electric Locomotives  \\n \\nWAG -5 and WA P- 1 & 3 locomotives manufactured at CLW are fitted with twin pipe dual brake \\nsystem. Railways have also converted some WAG -4 locomotive to twin pipe dual brake system. \\nDual brake system is designed for hauling stock equipped with either graduated release type single \\npipe or twin pipe air brakes or vacuum brakes.  \\n \\nThe instructions contained herein are in supplement to GR and SR. Simple schematic diagram \\nexplaining the principle of operation of working of dual brake system, vacuum brake system and \\ncharging of main reservoir Is attached as Annexure 3.02 A, 3.02 B, 3.01 C.  \\n \\n1. Description of the brake system  \\n \\nThe main features of the system as fitted on these locos are -  \\n \\n1.1 Self-lapping type independent brakes on the locomotive, i.e., the brakes on locos c an be \\napplied and released in steps with pressure maintaining feature in all positions.  \\n \\n1.2  Braking of air braked passenger/freight trailing stock and at the same time proportional brake \\napplication on locomotive through distributor valve.  \\n \\n1.3 Braking  of air braked passenger/freight trailing stock fitted with graduated released type of \\nbrake equipment, and at the same time proportional brake application on locomotive through \\ndistributor valve.  \\n \\n1.4 Dynamic brake interlock to prevent simultaneously app lication of automatic air brakes and \\ndynamic brakes on loco. Automatic brake application of brakes on loco and trailing stock in case of \\nfailure of dynamic brakes.  \\n \\n1.5 Multiple unit operations with locos fitted with similar type of brake system.  \\n \\n1.6 In an emergency, brake pipe and vacuum train pipe can be directly vented simultaneously by \\nthe emergency brake valve provided in front of assistant driver\\'s seat.  \\n \\n1.7  Loco brakes can be released independent of the train brakes.  \\n \\n1.8  Provision for freigh t/passenger change -over cocks to regulate locomotive air brake \\napplication timings depending upon the type of stock to be operated by locomotive.  \\n \\n1.9 Provision for the driver to apply independent brakes on leading loco in MU operation in case \\nof parting between locomotives.  \\n \\n1.10  In case of very heavy leakage in the feed pipe or failure of feed pipe inter -coupling \\nequipment, twin pipe brake system on trailing stock can be worked as single pipe system by simply \\nisolating the feed pipe of trailing stock f rom locomotives.  \\n \\n1. 11  Power cut off during emergency brake application.  \\n \\n1. 12  Visual indication on driver\\'s cab through air flow indicator device during train parting, alarm \\nchain pulling or Guard\\'s emergency brake valve operation or loco parting wh ile hauling air braked \\nstock.  \\n \\n1. 13  Audio/visual indication in driver\\'s cab to indicate the failure of D -24B feed valve which feeds \\nair pressure for electrical controls.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [95] 2. Compressed ai r system: (Ref.. SKDP -2350 Alt. 4)  \\n \\n2.1 Compressed air delivered by the motor driven compressors is stored in the main reservoirs \\nafter being cooled by after coolers. Three safety valves set at 11.5 kg/cm2 are provided to safeguard \\nthe compressors against  build up of air pressure to a very high value, in case of failure of check \\nvalves. The compressors are controlled by electro -pneumatic governor,to cut in at 3.5±0.1 kg./cm2  \\nand cut out at 10±0.1 kg/cm2 pressure. One more safety valve set to blow off at 1 0.5±0.1 kg/cm2 is \\nfitted between the second and the third main reservoir in case the pressure governor fails to \\noperate.  \\n2.2 Compressed air at reduced pressure of 8 kg/cm2 is stored in the control reservoir. This air is \\nsupplied for all electrical contact ors. A pressure switch provided after the feed valve gives an audio \\nvisual indication through a buzzer    and an indication lamp in each cab, in case pressure in the \\ncontrol reservoir falls below 6.0±0.1 kg/cm2 and cuts off the audio visual indication when  the \\npressure rises to 6.0±0.1 kg/cm2.  \\n2.3 In release position of the A -9 automatic brake valve, main reservoir air flows to the regulating \\nportion of auto brake valve, where it is reduced to a predetermined pressure. The regulated air \\npressure flows thro ugh the auto brake valve to the C -2 relay valve to charge the air brake pipe. The \\nair brake pipe pressure can be adjusted by adjusting the regulator of auto brake valve.  \\n \\n3.  Independent brakes  \\n3.1  Self-lapping SA -9 type independent air brake valve is provided in each cab for application \\nand release of air brakes on locomotive. The leakage in the brake cylinder is automatically \\ncompensated and air pressure in the brake cylinders is automatically maintained between zero and \\nmaximum value depending upon b rake valve handle position.  \\n3.2 Isolating cocks are provided in the air supply and delivery pipes of the independent brake \\nvalve to isolate the defective or unused brake valve in the inoperative cab(s).  \\n \\n4. Vacuum system  \\n4.1  Two exhausters, are provid ed to create vacuum in the vacuum system of the loco and the \\nvacuum trains pipe (VTP) for operating vacuum braked trailing stock. Normally one exhauster is run \\nto maintain vacuum in the system. Two exhausters can also be operated, if necessary.  \\n4.2 Exhaus ter(s) create vacuum in the V.T.P. through VA -1-B control valve when A -9 (drivers \\nautomatic brake valve) is placed in \"release\" position. The vacuum in the V.T.P. is limited by two \\nvacuum relief valves set at 60 cms max. with hose pipe on dummy. Exhausters  are protected \\nagainsts ingress of dirt and dust by GD/80 -H type oil bath filters. Leakage of atmospheric air through \\nthe idle exhauster is avoided by non -return valve. Vacuum relief valves in the exhauster line protect \\nthe exhauster(s) against high vacuum  when the VA -1-B control valve is the disconnected from train \\npipe during brake application. The desired vacuum in the VTP during release position is controlled \\nby the HS -4 control air valve. In release position of the automatic brake valve A -9, VA -1-B con trol \\nvalve is actuated by the air brake pipe pressure and the control valve piston is moved down to \\nconnect the exhauster to the VTP.  \\n \\n5. Operation of brakes on trailing stock equipped with air brake equipment  \\n \\n5.1 In \\'release\\' position of A -9 automatic brake valve, main reservoir air flows to the regulating \\nportion of automatic brake valve at a predetermined pressure, normally 5kg/cm2. The regulated air \\npressure flows through MU -2B valve to the C -2 relay valve. This control pressure actuates C -2 relay \\nvalve which in turn connects main reservoir to brake pipe and charges the brake pipe and the \\nconnected system to the same pressure level through out the train. Any leakage in the train system \\nis automatically compensated by this relay valve.  \\n5.2 When the brake valve handle is moved to minimum reduction position, reduction of pressure \\nin brake  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill     [96] pipe by 0.2 to 0.5 kg/cm2 (3 to 8 PSI) is achieved and proportional application of brakes on loco and \\ntrains takes place. In full service position of the automatic brake valve handle, the BP pressure is \\nreduced to 3.5 kg/cm2 .  \\n \\n5.3 The A -9 automatic brake valve handle when placed in emergency position, vents brake pipe \\npressure at a very fast rate to atmosphe re to initiate an emergency brake application. Regression of \\npower also takes place due to the actuation of H -5 relay air valve. Reduction in pressure in the \\nbrake pipe actuates the distributor valve on the loco and trailing stock to apply brakes.  \\n5.4 The C-3-W distributor valve provided in the brake circuit, is connected to the brake pipe and \\nresponds to the variations of pressure in the brake pipe. It applies proportionate brake application \\non loco - motive when train brakes are applied either through Aut omatic or Emergency brake valve. \\nThe C - 3-W distributor has a built in Goods/Passenger changeover cock to regulate brake cylinder \\npressure depending on whether it is hauling Passenger or freight train.  \\n \\n5.5 32 mm feed pipe through -out the train is charged  from the first two main reservoirs, through \\nduplex check valve and feed valve set at 6.0 ± 0.1 kg/cm2 and is used for filling auxiliary reservoirs \\nof the trailing stock initially as well as after the air from these reservoirs has been consumed during \\nbraking. The main advantage of this additional pipe is to reduce the release and recharging time of \\nthe train after brake application.  \\n \\n6. Operation of brakes on trailing stock equipped with vacuum brake equipment  \\n \\n6.1 In release position of the automatic br ake valve handle, the brake pipe is charged to 5.0 \\nkg/cm2 and vacuum in vacuum train pipe is created through VA -1-B control valve. When the brake \\nvalve handle is moved from release position towards application position, the brake pipe pressure \\nand vacuum i n VTP is reduced and maintained to a value depending on the handle movement.  \\n6.2 The reduction in brake pipe pressure operates the VA -1-B control valve to admit \\natmospheric air into the vacuum train pipe, to apply brakes on the vacuum braked trailing stoc k. \\nDuring application, the exhauster connection with the vacuum train pipe is cut off by the VA -1-B \\ncontrol valve. After the - desired degree of brake application has taken place, depending upon the \\nextent of brake pipe pressure reduced the valve laps and m aintains automatically the vacuum level \\nagainst normal vacuum train pipe leakage.  \\n \\n6.3 When the driver feels that it is not necessary to apply brake on a loco, during automatic \\napplication the brake release pedal switch is pressed to release the loco brak es. The D -1 pilot air \\nvalve is energised to cut off automatic air brakes on the loco while train brakes remain applied on \\nthe trailing stock.  \\n6.4 During train parting while hauling vacuum braked stock, the vacuum in the train pipe falls \\nsuddenly. with a d rop of vacuum by about 10 to 15 cm an unbalance in the VA -1-B control valve is \\ncreated allowing controlled air pressure to actuate HB -5 relay air valve to operate pressure switch \\nthrough double check valve for regression of power.  \\n \\n7. The operation of eme rgency brake  \\nValve D -1 provided in each cab, near the assistant driver\\'s seat, directly connects the vacuum train \\npipe and air brake pipe to atmosphere thereby applying brakes on loco and trailing stock at the \\nquickest possible rate. The circuit for auto  regression of the loco power due to the actuation of H - 5 \\nrelay air valve is also automatically made. This relay valve also regresses power if the BP pressure \\ndrops due to any reason.  \\n \\n8. Dynamic brakes   \\nD-1 pilot air valve cuts off loco brakes.  \\n8.1 While c ontrolling train with dynamic brakes, if  the dynamic brakes fails, brakes on the loco \\nand train will be applied automatically.                                                       \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill    [97] 9.  Air flow i ndicator  \\n \\n9.1 Air flow indicator, a relay valve, one pressure switch and two flow indicator gauges (one in \\neach cab) have been provided to give an indication of the air flow rate in the brake pipe of the train. \\nAny abnormal increase in air flow in the bra ke pipe because of train parting, loco parting, alarm \\nchain pulling, heavy leakage in brake pipe, guard van valve application or bursting of air brake pipe \\nhose would give visual indication to the driver by air flow gauge needle and by glowing of a bulb in  \\nthe cab. On getting the indication driver should apply brakes through A -9 automatic brake valve/D -1 \\nair/ vacuum emergency valve depending upon the condition of the train and the emergency.  \\n \\n10. Multiple unit operation  \\n \\n10.1 When two or more locos are to  be coupled together in multiple unit operation, the brake pipe, \\nthe feed pipe, vacuum train pipe ( if vacuum braked stock to be operated), the main reservoir \\nequalising pipe and brake cylinder equalising pipe hoses must be coupled between the locos, and \\nthe respective angle cocks shall be opened.  \\n \\n10.2 The compressors and exhausters of the trailing locos would also be working during multiple \\noperation. The automatic and independent brake valve handles in the trailing loco and on the \\nunused cab of the lead ing loco shall be kept in \\'Release\\' position and the isolating cocks provided \\nnear both brake valves should be closed.  \\n \\n10.3 MU-2-B valve provided to supply MR air to VA -1 release valve (11) and F -1 selector valve \\nshould be kept in \\'lead\\' in the leading l oco and in \\'Trail\\' position in the trailing locos. Isolating cock in \\nthe brake pipe charging line should be kept in lead position (open) in leading loco and trail position \\n(close) in the trailing loco(s).  \\n \\n11. Gauges  \\n \\nThere are five gauges in each drivin g cab. These gauges indicate BC, MR, FP, VTP, Air Flow, BP \\npressures to the driver. Apart from these, three single Pressure gauges are provided. One single \\npressure gauge is fitted near the panto reservoir. The second gauge is provided in the brake pipe \\nline to show the brake pipe pressure. One single pressure gauge is provided to indicate the \\npressure in the control side of the VA -1-B control valve, which is regulated by HS -4 control valve.  \\n \\n12. General  \\n \\n12.1 It should be noted that whenever the vacuum s etting is done - through the vacuum relief \\nvalve, this should be done by seeing the single vacuum gauge fitted in driver\\'s cab.  \\n \\n12.2 The first two main reservoirs are provided with auto drain valve and the condensate is \\nautomatically drained off during th e \"cut out\" and \"cut -in\" cycle of the compressor governor. All the \\nother three main reservoirs are provided with manual drain cocks to drain off periodically the \\ncondensate collected in the reservoirs.  \\n \\n12.3 The main reservoir also supplies compressed air  to auxiliaries such as wipers horns and \\nsanders. The MR equalising pipe is charged from the main reservoirs through a duplex check valve \\nset at 5.0±0. lkg/cm2. \\n \\n12.4 The main reservoir also supplies compressed air to electrical auxiliaries such as \\npantographs,  tap changers, Board of gaduator etc. At the time of initial energisation of loco or when \\nthere is insufficient pressure in pantograph reservoir to raise the pantograph, battery driven auxiliary \\ncompressor is operated to build up pressure in the pantograph  reservoir and auxiliary circuit to \\nenergise the loco. The pantograph reservoir is protected against pressure leakage by a diaphragm \\noperated cock. One safety valve to cut out at 8.5 + 0. 1 kg/cm2 has been provided to safeguard the \\nbaby compressor from exc essive pressure.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [98]     \\n \\nCHAPTER IV  \\n \\nMAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL SCHEDULES OF EMU’s  \\n \\nPara No                 Subject  \\n \\n30400          General  \\n \\n30401    Scheduled Inspections  \\n \\n30402    EMU Fitness Certificate  \\n \\n30403           Testing Air Brakes  \\n30404          Maintenance of Vacuu m Brakes  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS      AC  TRACTION     MANUAL  VOLUME Ill     [102]  CHAPTER    IV  \\n \\nMAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL SCHEDULES OF EMUs  \\n \\nII. 30400 General  \\n \\nPara 30300, 30301 and 30303 will be applicable to EMU mutatis -mutandis  as well.  \\n \\nIII. 30401 Scheduled Inspection  \\nIV. The motorman, after overnight stabling of EMUs, while taking over shall ensure draining off \\nof the air reservoirs to expel accumulated water.  \\n \\na) The Maintenance and Overhaul Schedules to be followed for AC  EMUs will generally be as \\nunder -  \\n \\ni) Daily Inspection  \\n \\nii) Trip Inspection (IT)  \\n \\niii) Monthly Inspection (IA)  \\n \\niv) Quarterly Inspection (IB)  \\n \\nV) Half Yearly Inspection (IC)  \\n \\nVi) Intermediate Overhaul (IOH)  \\n \\nvii) POH  \\n \\nb) The daily inspection is esse ntially an inspection to be carried out by the ‘Running’ Section.  It \\nmay also be carried out in a shed if convenient or at an outstation when the unit is stabled overnight \\naway from the shed.  IT, IA, IB, IC  and IOH should be carried out  in the homing s hed for each EMU \\nwhereas POH should be carried out at the workshop nominated for this purpose for each railway.  \\nc)  The details of work to be done during each schedule require periodical review in the light of \\nlocal conditions and operating experience with  each type of EMU. The details given in Annexure \\n4.01 are for guidance only.  \\n \\nV. 30402 EMU Fitness Certificate  \\n \\nInstructions contained in Chapter Ill (Para 30304) for locos will apply mutatis -mutandis for EMU as \\nwell.

Before an EMU train is issued for traffic from a shed after scheduled inspections, POH or \\nunscheduled re pairs, a supervisor of the M5 section should test the air brakes of the complete train \\nformation. The brakes should be  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill     [103]  \\n \\ntested from the driving cabs at both ends of the train formation.  A list of items to be checked in the case of Westinghouse brakes of ICF EMUs is given below for \\nguidance. Detailed check lists on similar lines should be prepared for different types on EMUs and \\nunits fitted with Knorr brakes. These should be in the form of print ed forms. The completed forms \\nduly signed by the supervisor of M5 should be preserved in the PPO for a period of six months.  \\nCheck  \\ni)     that all inter -car hose connections are made and all coupling, isolating the drain cocks are in the \\nnormal position.   \\nii)    that MR pressure is maintained between 5.8 and 7 kg/cm2   and the compressors start and stop \\nrespectively at these values of pressure.  \\niii)   that when the Driver\\'s control switch, EP brake switch and isolating valve switch are put on, the \\ngreen indicator light in the driving cab glows.  \\niv)    that the brake pipe pressure builds upto 4.57 kg/cm2 in approx. 90 seconds.  \\nv)     that when the brake controller handle is moved from position I to position II step by step ( a \\nminimum of 6 steps should b e used), the brake cylinder pressure builds upto the value proportional \\nto the handle position and is maintained at this value by the self -lapping mechanism. In position II \\nthe pressure should be 3.5 kg/cm2 for cast iron brake blocks and 1.5 kg/cm2 and 2.0  kg/cm2 for \\nmotor and trailer coaches respectively provided with composite brake blocks. When brakes are \\napplied the orange lamp should light -up to prove the application of brakes in all the bogies.  \\nvi)    that when the handle is moved back from position II to position I step -by-step ( a minimum of 6 \\nsteps should be used) the brake cylinder pressure is reduced to the value corresponding to the \\nhandle position and is maintained at this value by the self -lapping mechanism.  \\nvii)   that when the handle is qui ckly moved from position I to position II, the brake cylinder pressure \\nwill rise to the maximum set value.  \\nviii)  that on moving the controller handle from position II to position I, the brake cylinder pressure \\ndrops to zero.  \\nix)    that during EP applic ation and release the brake pipe pressure is not affected.  \\nx)     that when controller handle is moved from position I to position Ill and then to IV, the brake pipe \\npressure drops gradually with sound of escaping air, and brake cylinder pressure rises \\ncorrespondingly. When the controller handle is moved back to Ill, the drop in brake pipe pressure \\nand the rise in brake cylinder pressure should be arrested.  \\nxi)    that when controller handle is moved from position I (after allowing full BP pressure to bui ld up) \\nquickly to \\'Emergency\\' position V, brake pipe pressure is reduced rapidly and brake cylinder \\npressure rises to slightly more than 3.9 kg/cm2 within 2.5 seconds.  \\nxii)   that with the brake controller in the driving cab in position II the brake cylin ders on each bogie \\nare functioning and there is no leakage. Check also that the manual release valves have wires \\nattached to them to facilitate operation from the sides of the train.  \\n30404 Maintenance of Vacuum Brakes  \\nA brief description of vacuum brakes  is given in the Annexure 4.03. Instructions regarding \\nmaintenance of vacuum brakes are contained in TXR Manuals, the salient points of which are \\nsummarized below: -  \\nPeriodical Examination of Vacuum Brake Gear:  \\n1. All vacuum brake cylinders shall be lowered,  examined, cleaned and necessary repairs and \\nrenewals of rubber fittings effected, once in every 12 months. The code of the examining station \\nmaking such an examination, the date and words \"EXD\" shall be painted in white on the cylinder \\nthus : EXD -JTJ- 1 0- 1- 1 970.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill    [104]  2. In fitting up vacuum brake cylinders it is important to see that the lever of the brake shaft is \\nexactly parallel with the trunnions on which the cylinder swings so that no s ide or cross strains are \\nset up.  \\n3. When putting a rolling ring on to a piston, care should be taken to ensure that the ring is not \\ntwisted. Around the ring a seam line will be found, which should lie evenly and horizontally all -round \\nwhen in the groove. The correct alignment can be secured by pulling the ring slightly away from the \\ndrum of the piston on the opposite sides with the thumb and finger of each hand. A good rolling ring \\nis one which when allowed to hang from the finger will hang straight. Where as, if a ring twists when \\nbeing suspended it should be rejected. An air tight fit is made between the piston and cylinder by \\nthe rolling ring.  \\n4.    (i)    The stuffing box, gland and brass bush should be examined to ensure that they are intact \\nin all res pects. Excessively worn gland will cause air leak below the piston and hence should be \\nrenewed.  \\n(ii)   The gland is held in position by a brass ring having groove at top and bottom edges. When the \\nstuffing box is tightened the rubber gland is squeezed int o the grooves. On creating vacuum, the \\ngland packing gets tightened, due to atmospheric pressure acting over the outside of it.  \\n(iii)   The brass bush must be examined for wear, as this part has the important function of \\nmaintaining the piston rod steady in its movement. When the bush is worn excessively the travel of \\nthe piston becomes unsteady and jerky.  \\n5. The joint ring between the flanges of the vacuum chamber and cylinder should be in correct \\nposition. To retain the joint ring in exact alignment whi le the cylinder is being lifted into position, clips \\nmade out of split pins could be used.  \\n6. While tightening up the joint, the nuts should be screwed up evenly all -round and not too tightly or \\nhaphazardly.  \\nUnequal tightening of the nuts may cause the c ylinder being drawn out of shape. This should be \\navoided. The correct procedure is to tighten up opposite nuts while assembling. On creating vacuum \\nthe nuts should be tightened up finally.  \\n \\n7. The release valve has a flat valve head which normally remains  seated cutting off all direct \\ncommunication between the body of the valve and the vacuum chamber or top of the piston. This \\ncan be opened by pulling the release valve lever by hand. A defective seating washer or a \\ndiaphragm washer will allow air to enter above the piston when vacuum is destroyed and the \\nvacuum cylinder will not function properly. Such defective washers should be changed.  \\n8. Cleaning: When dismantling a cylinder for cleaning all rubber parts should be removed and kept \\nclear of oil or any o ther solvent likely to damage the rubber. French chalk may be used for cleaning \\nor dressing the rubber fittings, or the working surfaces of the cylinder and piston.  \\nIf it is found necessary to use a solvent to remove dirt from working surfaces of the meta l parts all \\ntraces of this solvent must be removed before replacing rubber parts, otherwise deterioration and \\nfailure in service are liable to occur. These working surfaces are coated with a special red rust -\\npreventing varnish and the solvent must be of a nature which will not affect this varnish. Emery \\npaper or cloth should never be used to clean the piston and cylinder.  \\n \\n9. The piston travel should be limited to a maximum of 4\" (100 mm) to ensure effective brake power.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRAC TION MANUAL VOLUME III   [105]   Annexure 4.01  \\n1.

All BG EMU stock have been provided wit h \\'self -lapping electro -pneumatic combined with \\nautomatic\\' compressed air brakes. Two makes of equipment are in use viz. Westinghouse and \\nKnorr -Bremese. Though the details of equipment differ appreciably, both systems are quite similar \\nin principle. The de scription given below pertains mainly to the Westinghouse equipment provided in \\nICF-built EMUs.  \\n \\n2. Electro -pneumatic braking is normally employed for service stops. The \\'automatic brakes\\' are \\nused under the following circumstances: -  \\n \\n(a) For automatic a pplication of brakes on both halves of a train in the event of a parting.  \\n \\n(b) For application by the Guard in an emergency.  \\n \\n(c) For automatic application due to operation of the dead -man\\'s device.  \\n \\n(d) For service stops by the Driver in the event of f ailure of control supply for EP brakes.  \\n \\n3. When Driver makes an emergency application both EP and Auto brakes apply,  \\n \\n4. The main components of the equipment are as under -  \\n \\n(a) A main reservoir system consisting of a compressor in each motor coach feed ing into main \\nreservoirs on motor coaches and supplementary reservoirs on trailer coaches interconnected from \\nend to end of the train by a main reservoir pipe with flexible couplings at ends of coaches. The main \\nreservoir is maintained at a pressure of 5.8  to 7.00 kg/cm2 by means of pressure governors \\ncontrolling each compressor. All the compressors in a train are synchronized to start and stop \\ntogether.  \\n \\n(b) A \\'brake pipe\\' from end to end of the train with flexible inter -connections between coaches. The \\npressure in this pipe is maintained at 4.57 kg/cm2 to keep the automatic brakes released.  \\n \\n(c) A \\'brake unit\\' in each coach consisting of the control valves for control of EP and auto brakes.  \\n \\n(d) The brake cylinders on each bogie with automatic slack -adjusters and associated brake rigging. \\nUsually the number of brake cylinders is four per bogie on motor coaches and two per bogie on \\ntrailer coaches.  \\n \\n(e) A brake controller in each driving cab. The controller in the driving cab in use being made \\noperative by means of an \\'Isolating valve switch\\' operated by the Driver\\'s key.  \\n(f) A brake application relay in each driving cab, the one in the operative cab responding to the \\noperation of the brake controller to control the supply to the brake control train wir es carried along \\nwith the other control wires In the inter -vehicular couplers.  \\n(g) Five train wires, viz . EP supply wire, brake application wire, brake holding wire, brake indication \\nwire and EP return wire.  \\n(h) A warning system to indicate to the Driv er if EP brakes have applied and to warn him if a failure \\ntakes place.  \\n(i) A pilot valve and emergency valve to operate the brakes if the deadman\\'s device is released,  \\n \\n(j) Isolating cocks, pressure gauges and control switches.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TR ACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [114]   (k) Release valves for manual release of brakes in individual bogies.  \\n \\n5. Each coach has an \\'EP brake unit\\' which houses the control valves for both EP and auto -brakes. \\nThe \\'pipe - bracket\\' arrangement is used where by the valves are bolted on to a casting which has \\nthe requisite inter connections between valves by means of cored passages in the casting itself, the \\nonly external pipe connections being from the main reservoir and brake pipes and to the brake \\ncylinder and atmosphere.  \\n6) The brake controller handle has five positions as under - \\n(a)  I           .. .. ..              Release and Running.  \\n(b) II       ...........   Full service EP.  \\n(c) III     .............  Lap(for auto application)  \\n(d) IV     ................        Service automatic   \\n(e) V          .................      Emergency.  \\nLower brake cylinder pressures with self -lapping feature as explained later are obtainable for \\nintermediate positions of the handle between positions I and II, the actual brake c ylinder pressure \\nbeing dependent upon the degree of handle movement away from position I.  \\n \\n7. Fig 4.01 is a block diagram explaining the functioning of the EP brakes. When an EP application \\nis to be made, the controller handle is moved from position I tow ards position II. First the holding \\ntrain wire is energized which energizes the. holding magnet valves throughout the train, thus \\nclosing, the exhaust, from the brake cylinders. The application valves are then energized via the \\napplication train wire. This  causes compressed air to flow to the brake cylinder  from the main \\nreservoir pipe, the rate of flow being controlled by a choke (not shown in the figure). If the \\napplication valve remains energized, the pressure in the brake cylinder 2 builds upto 3.5 kg/ cm2, \\nany rise of pressure beyond this value being prevented by the \\'limiting valve’.  \\n \\n8. Between positions I and II the self -lapping mechanism controls the brake cylinder pressure. Fig \\n4.02 shows the self -lapping mechanism schematically. Movement of the c ontroller handle towards II \\ncompresses a spring in a small control cylinder, the amount of compression depending upon the \\ndegree of handle movement. This spring acts on a piston at the back of which air pressure form the \\nbrake cylinders of the leading bogi e is applied. When the brake cylinder pressure exceeds the value \\ncorresponding to the controller handle position, the mechanism de - energizes the application train -\\nwire, thus limiting the brake cylinder pressure to the value corresponding to the handle pos ition. If \\nthe brake -cylinder pressure drops on account of leakage etc. the application wire is re -energized. If \\nthe handle is moved backwards, the holding wire is de -energized till the brake cylinder pressure \\ndrops to the required value. The self -lapping m echanism thus automatically controls the brake \\ncylinder pressure at a definite value corresponding to the handle position and enables graduated \\napplication and release. In. position II and V the application and holding circuits are energized by \\n\\'positive a cting\\' contacts bypassing the self -lapping mechanism, the pressure then being limited by \\nthe limiting valve as explained earlier.  \\n \\n9 Two indication lamps are provided on the Driver\\'s desk -a green lamp to indicate that EP brake \\ncontrol supply is available and an orange lamp which lights up when brake application -is made if \\npressure has built up in all the bogies, which is detected by a pressure switch, the pressure \\nswitches in all the coaches being connected in series. The extinguishing of the green lamp i ndicates \\ntotal failures of EP brakes necessitating use of the automatic brakes to control the train. Failure of \\nthe orange lamps to light up when brakes are applied indicates partial failure of the EP brakes. The \\nDriver has then to be very vigilant and sho uld be prepared to control, the train, if required, by using \\nauto brakes.  \\n \\n10. Fig 4.03 is a block diagram explaining the function of the automatic brakes. When the brake \\ncontroller in the driving cab is in position I and the controller is put into operat ion by putting on the \\n\\'Isolating valve switch\\', compressed air is fed to the brake pipe from the MR pipe via a reducing \\nvalve in the brake controller which ensures that the pressure in the brake pipe is built up and \\nremains steady at 4.57 kg/cm2.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill    [115]  The vital component in the automatic brake system is the \\'triple valve\\' which forms a part of the EP \\nbrake unit in each coach. Its functions are -  \\n \\n (a) When pressure in the brake pipe is 4.57 kg/cm2, it opens the brake cylinder to atmosphere thus \\nreleasing the brakes and at the same time connects the brake pipe to an Auxiliary Reservoir in each \\ncoach storing compressed air at a pressure of 4.57 kg/cm2 in the Auxiliary reservoir.  \\n \\n(b) When pressure i n the brake pipe is reduced either voluntarily by the Driver or the Guard or due \\nto parting of train or operation of the deadman\\'s device etc., it closes the exhaust from the brake \\ncylinder and connects the auxiliary reservoir to the brake cylinders, allow ing the stored air in the \\nreservoir to flow into the brake cylinders. The volume of the auxiliary reservoir is so chosen that the \\nmaximum pressure in the brake cylinders is limited to 3.5 kg/CM2. The triple valve also has a \\'lap\\' \\nposition whereby it is pos sible to control the brake cylinder pressure to values below 3.5 kg/cm2 by \\nholding the brake pipe pressure at intermediate values making use of position III on the brake \\ncontroller.  \\n \\n(c) When the brake pipe is recharged by moving the controller to positio n I, the triple valve returns to \\nthe position indicated in (a), thus releasing the brakes and storing air in the auxiliary reservoir in \\nreadiness for the next application.  \\nNot shown in Fig 4.03 is a \\'triple valve stabilizing valve\\' which ensures that the triple valve does not \\nreact to small pressure pulsations.  \\n \\n11. In position V (i.e., \\'emergency\\') of the brake controller, both EP and auto brakes apply together. \\nRapid application of the automatic brakes is obtained by quick venting of the brake pipe to \\natmosphere. A safety valve in the brake unit on each coach prevents excessive pressure in the \\nbrake cylinders. This valve is normally set at 3. 9 kg/CM2.  \\n \\n12. Release of the deadman\\'s device by the Driver results in quick venting of the brake pipe to \\natmos phere via an \\'emergency valve\\' resulting in full auto application.  \\n \\n13. A valve is provided in each driving cab to enable the Guard to vent the brake pipe to \\natmosphere and thus cause brake application. A gauge is provided close to this valve to indicate the \\nbrake pipe pressure to the Guard.  \\n \\n14. A pressure switch usually called the \\'control governor\\' connected to the brake pipe prevents \\napplication of power to the traction motors till the brakes are kept ready . This control governor \\nopens and cuts off t raction control  supply if the brake pipe pressure is reduced.  \\n \\n15. A \\'duplex\\' pressure gauge is, provided in the driving cab to indicate to the Driver the pressure in \\nthe main reservoir and brake pipes. Another duplex gauge indicate to him the pressure i n the brake \\ncylinders of the two leading bogies.  \\n \\n16. Isolating cocks are provided to isolate a defective brake unit form the MR and brake pipes and \\nalso to Isolate brake cylinders in individual bogies.  \\n \\n17. The brake cylinders are equipped with automati c slack -adjusters to take up the slack in the \\nbrake rigging with wear of brake blocks, thus ensuring fairly constant piston stroke and obviating the \\nneed for manual adjustment of the brake -rigging between visits of the units to the shed. This is an \\nessenti al feature of brake equipment for suburban services, when the brake block wear is quite high \\non account of frequent application of brakes.  \\n \\n18. The Knorr system is quite similar to the equipment described above . In this system , however, \\nthe automatic br akes become operative automatically on  failure of the EP system. With this \\narrangement the brake controller has only three positions viz., \\'release\\', \\'full service application\\' and \\n\\'emergency\\'.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill      [116]  Annexure 4.03  \\n \\nVACUUM   BRAKES  \\n1. Vacuum brakes are provided in some EMU (MG). A description of the brake equipment together \\nwith some details on general maintenance of vacuum brakes in goods and passenger vehicles is \\ntherefore included here, F ig 4.04 give the schematic diagram of the system as adopted in MG \\nEMUs.  \\n2. When vacuum is created in the train pipe, the ball valve establishes communication between the \\nchamber above the piston and portion of cylinder below the piston. With equal vacuum above and \\nbelow the piston, the piston comes down\" by gravity and the brakes are released. When vacuum in \\nthe train pipe is reduced by admission of air, the ball valve closes and the pressure of air below the \\npiston moves it up, the piston movement being a ssisted by the rolling ring. The amount by which the \\nvacuum is reduced in the train pipe determines the braking force.  \\n3. When a cylinder has to be manually released the \\'release valve\\' is operated to establish \\ncommunication between the chamber and the po rtion of cylinder below the piston. With equal \\nvacuum on both sides of the piston, the piston comes down by gravity and the brakes get released.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill    [118]  Proforma 4 .01 \\n(Refer para – 30402)  \\nRAILWAY  \\nE.M.U.

They shall particularly acquai nt themselves \\nwith details of temporary speed restrictions imposed in the section in which they have to work, \\ndetails of caution orders and advice of defective signals. If any person has not understood any of \\nthe instructions, he may seek clarification fro m the ATFR on duty.  \\n \\n30513 Availability of Dry Sand  \\n \\nAll electric locos and EMUs are fitted with sanding equipments to improve adhesion and prevent \\nwheel -slipping when starting under difficult conditions e.g. up -gradients or when rails are wet. \\nSanding i s effected by means of electro -pneumatic valves to sand the front axles of each bogie in \\nthe direction of motion, the control being achieved by a pedal switch in each cab. Means are \\nprovided to adjust the height of the sanding nozzles. In modern locos auto matic sanding takes place \\non the onset of incipient slipping.  \\n \\nThe sand to be used should not cake in the sand box and should be dry, free from clay, loam, mica \\nand other foreign materials. A detailed specification for the sand has been issued by RDSO. \\nFacilities should be available in all loco sheds and such outstation depots as considered necessary \\nfor ensuring an adequate supply of screened and dry sand. Special care is also required during \\ninspections to ensure the water -tightness of sand box covers.  \\n \\n30514 Seasonal Precautions  \\n \\n1. A few essential precautions required to be taken prior to the commencement of the monsoon, \\npre-summer season and pre -winter season are listed below. Local instructions may be issued to \\nsupplement these lists as required.  \\n \\n2. The pre -monsoon precautions  \\n \\na) Test the water -tightness of loco/EMU body including roof by means of a high pressure water jet \\nand seal all leakage points. (It must be ensured that the loco / EMU is well away from live OHE to \\nprevent the water jet comi ng into contact with live wires).  \\n \\nb) After the first rain the loco /EMU should be Inspected thoroughly to detect and attend to leakage \\npoints. Special attention should be paid to the following water leakage points -  \\n \\ni) Body joints  \\nii) Joints of the m ounting bases of the roof equipment.  \\niii) Joints of marker lights.  \\niv) Joints of look -out glasses and side glasses.  \\n \\nv) Door gaskets .  \\n \\nvi) Sand -box joints.  \\n \\nvii) Roof gaskets.  \\n \\nviii) Head light gaskets   \\n \\nc) The wind -screen wipers should be tested a nd attended to.  \\n \\nd) Roof joints with super -structure -roof gasket should be in good fettle.  \\n \\ne) Joints of side body filter with super structure.  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill     [130]  f) Ensure cleanliness of roof gutter.  \\n \\ng) Proper functioning of sanders should be ensured.  \\n \\n3. The pre -summer precautions :  \\n \\na) Clean all filters and check depression with a water manometer to ensure that the cleaning has \\nbeen thoroughly done.  \\nb) The loco interior should be thoroughly cleaned of  any accumulation of oil and dust.  \\n \\nc) Axle boxes should be thoroughly examined.  \\n \\nd) Drivers must he alerted to feel the axle boxes as often as possible.  \\n \\ne) Fans in the driver\\'s cabs should be attended to.  \\n \\nf) Relay covers are properly provided and se aled to avoid ingress of dust.  \\n \\n4. The pre -winter precautions :  \\n \\na) Heaters : It should be ensured that all the four cab, heaters are in working order  \\n \\nb) Window Shutters : The window shutter sealing gaskets should be checked and made air tight.  \\n \\nc) Do ors : Ensure that cab doors and corridor doors locking handles are in working order. The door \\nsealing gaskets     should be held tight in the position.  \\n \\nd) Cab Ventilators : Ventilator cover sealing should be perfect.  \\n \\ne) TFP : Main power transformer and  Tap changer breather silica - gel condition should be checked \\nand replaced if necessary. Oil levels in TFP & GR to be checked and oil tested for DE.  \\n \\nf)Oil Baths : Main compressor and exhausters oil baths should be checked and oil replaced, if \\nnecessary.  \\n \\ng) Sanders :Sand boxes should be checked : wet sand removed and dry sand filled.  \\n \\nh) Traction Motors : TM inspection cover sealing gaskets should be checked to ensure that there is \\nno air leakage  \\n \\ni) Pantograph : The servomotor of pantographs should be drained off and regrease .

The trailing loads assigned to various types and classes of locomotives will be governed by the \\nLoad Chart issued by RDSO. (refer  Annexure 1.03). These loads are worked out taking the \\ntheoretical site condition and the track geometry specified in the drawings. Actual site condition and \\nthe track geometry may differ. The ruling gradient of the section may differ from the declared grade \\nand the section may have curves, the radius of which may be different from the radius taken in the \\ncalculation of the assigned load. Further, partial brake binding , capability of an average driver \\ncombined with adverse weather condition may affect the actual load that can he  hauled by a \\nlocomotive in a particular section. Therefore, before the loads of a particular class of locomotive are \\nfixed for various sections, the actual trials with specified loads on these section should be carried \\nout. The trial would ensure the abili ty of the locomotive to start and haul the nominated load on the \\nruling gradient.  \\n \\n2. For multiple operation, separate trials should be carried out with 2,3 or 4 locos in multiples as \\nrequired in actual operation. These need not be exact multiples of load s with a single loco, since the \\nsharing of loads by the locos may not be equal due to various manufacturing tolerances, varying \\nwheel diameters etc.  \\n \\n3. The nominated loads both for single and multiple operation should be determined for each \\nsection, loco  class - wise and tabulated.  \\n \\n4. Loads for each section with multiple operation should be given in the table as mentioned above \\nand also when the motors or pairs of motors have been cut out.  \\n \\n5 The loads will be fixed section wise for each class of locomo tive by CEE in consultation with COM.  \\n \\n30602 Time Tabling and Loco Link Diagrams  \\n \\nTo achieve maximum utilization of locomotives, loco link diagrams should be prepared in such a \\nmanner that the locomotives are kept on the run for the maximum number of hou rs each day with \\nthe minimum detentions at terminal  stations. This work has to be done by close co -ordination \\nbetween Sr DOM/DOM and Sr DEE(OP)/ DEE(OP).  \\n \\n30603 Assessment of Operating Staff for Electric Locos .  \\n \\n1.   For mail, express and passenger serv ices running staff links are prepared based on the time \\ntable and keeping in view the prescribed minimum rest to be given at out -stations and headquarters \\nstation. This will give the bare number of sets of running staff required. Each set will consist of o ne \\ngrade A Driver and one Assistant Driver. For Rajdhani/Shatabdi Expresses or other high speed \\ntrains the assessment of crew will be modified suitably since the function of Asstt. Driver are \\nperformed by a Co -driver booked to assist the train driver.  \\n \\n2.   Requirement of running staff for goods services is arrived at on the basis of the \"turn -round\" \\nmethod. The turn -round of a Driver is \"signing on time\" to \"signing off time\" and includes waiting \\nduty at both ends.  \\n \\n- The average turn -round time \\'T\\' hou rs for a Driver is equal to average time from signing  on \\nat the starting station till commencement of journey plus average journey time plus average time \\nfrom arrival at destination to signing off.  \\n \\n- If there are N trains to be run per day, the total Dri ver hours per day will be equal to Tx N \\nhours  \\n \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III     (135)  At an average of 104 hours of duty for 14 days per driver, the number of drivers required will be TxN \\ndivided by 104/14.   \\n \\nEach set of staff t o operate goods train will consist of a grade ‘B’ or ‘C’ Driver and one Assistant \\nDriver.  \\n \\n3. The detailed procedure for assessing the Running Staff requirement has been given in Operating \\nManual of Zonal Railways . Running Staff requirement and its review  shall, therefore, be carried out \\nas per instructions laid down in that Manual.  \\na) leave reserves in the appropriate category as per prescribed percentages ;  \\nb) special and non -scheduled trains ;  \\nc) loco shed working ;  \\nd) overlapping crew at out stations;  \\ne) relief crew  en route ;  \\nf) trainee reserve in the prescribed category ;  \\ng) other special duties.  \\n \\n30604 Duties of Electric Loco Drivers  \\nIn addition to the duties laid down for Drivers in Chapter IV Of General and Subsidiary Rules, \\nDrivers shall be responsible for the follo wing:  \\n \\n1.

The Driver must \\nnot allow any one to enter any of the driving compartments, other than those who are authorised to \\ndo so under the rules or hold a permit issued by Sr DEE/DEE/(OP).  \\n \\n Normally not more than three persons other than running  staff will be permitted to travel in the cab.  \\n \\nA Driver who is off duty is not permitted to enter or travel in any of the driving compartment unless \\nauthorized by TLC and that too for travel towards headquarters after being relieved en -route. This \\nwill b e permitted only in the non driving cab/cabs.  \\n \\n30609 Interference with Equipment.  \\n \\nDrivers and Assistant Drivers will not tamper with the measuring instruments, speed recorder and \\nprotective relays.  \\nRelays or other sealed equipment should not be opened o r wedged except as authorized in the \\ntrouble shooting manual. If a driver opens a relay or breaks the seal of any equipment, full \\nparticulars should be noted in the loco log book. Particular care is also necessary while putting back \\nmetallic covers of rela ys to avoid inadvertent shorting of live terminals.  \\n \\n30610 Checks on the Run by the Driver  \\n \\nOn the run, the Driver shall be primarily concerned with keeping a sharp look -out for signals and \\nwatching the road. However, he should, from time to time, keep a n eye on the vacuum and pressure \\ngauges, the voltmeters and ammeters as well as the speedometer and notch indicator, to assure \\nhimself that everything is in order.  \\n \\nApart from keeping a close watch of signals ahead, and signals from the Guard, the Assista nt Driver \\nshall keep a special watch on the battery voltage and the battery current. In addition as often as \\npossible, he shall check the working of the blowers and keep a watch on the transformer and tap \\nchanger oil level.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [138 ]  The Assistant Driver should not normally leave the driving cab to inspect the equipment in the \\ncorridors when the train is approaching a station or at locations where speed restrictions exist.  \\n \\n30611 Change of Locomotive Crew at Stations  \\n \\nThe relieving Driver should make a general inspection of the underframe, drain the main reservoir \\nand feel by hand the axle boxes and motor bearings to make sure they are not hot, before entering \\nthe cab. The relieved Driver shall acquai nt the relieving Driver about any abnormalities noticed \\nduring the preceding run. The relieving Driver shall note and initial the entries in the log book. The \\nrelieving Assistant Drivers should take over the loco tools.  \\n \\n30612 Service Troubles on Line  \\n \\nEvery locomotive Driver is expected to be fully trained to deal with troubles which may be \\nexperienced while a locomotive is on the run. Drivers should keep themselves fully conversant with \\nfault finding procedures so that they are able to identify the faul t, isolate it, give first aid attention to \\nthe equipment to keep the locomotive functioning, until it arrives at the next station. The Driver may \\nconsult the Operating Manual for the type of loco where necessary to refresh his memory.  \\n \\nShould a locomotive  fail completely and the Driver is unable to start it on his own, he should seek \\nthe help and guidance of the Traction loco Controller by plugging the portable telephone set to the \\nnearest emergency telephone socket within 20 minutes.  \\n \\n30613 Entering Equi pment Compartment  \\n \\nIf the Driver or Assistant Driver has to enter the equipment compartment of a loco he should take \\ncare to see that the cab doors and drop windows on both sides are closed before opening the \\ncorridor door, to prevent dusty air being draw n into the equipment compartment.  \\n \\n30614 Driver\\'s Duty when Stabling a Loco  \\n \\nWhen stabling a loco in the loco shed or a stabling line, the Driver assisted by the Assistant Driver \\nshall carry out the following operations:  \\n \\n1.

Hand over the log book and keys of the loco in the TFR/ ATFR\\'s office before signing off.  \\n \\nWhen a locomotive is stabled on a pit line, the Driver shall also carry out under -gear and roof  \\nInspection in  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III     [139]  accordance with detailed instructions in the Operating Manual for the type of loco and make \\nnecessary remarks in the log book.  \\n \\n30615  Knowledge of Road  \\n \\n1. Every Dr iver (as well as Assistant Driver, and Shunter) shall have a good knowledge of the \\nsection before he is allowed to work a train in the section. He shall be fully conversant with the \\nmaximum permissible speeds, gradients and land marks on the section, the b lock and non -block \\nstations on the section, type and location of each individual signal and the line referred to by each \\nsignal, the speed restrictions to be observed and neutral sections. For learning road as mentioned \\nabove, he should be allowed a period  of training at the end of which he shall be orally tested by the \\nDriving Inspector. He should also sign a declaration stating that he is fully conversant with the road. \\nThe declaration should be witnessed and countersigned by the Driving Inspector and scr utinized by \\nthe officer concerned before issue of the Certificate of Competence.  \\n \\n2. When a Driver, Assistant Driver or Shunter has been absent from duty for a continuous period of \\nsix months, he shall not be permitted to work a train until he has again l earnt the road and his \\nCertificate of Competency revalidated after oral examination by the Driving Inspector and a fresh \\ndeclaration. The period of six months prescribed above may be reduced, if necessary, by local \\ninstructions issued by Sr DEE(OP) /DEE((O P). These instructions shall be equally valid if the driver \\ndid not have the opportunity to work on the section whatsoever be the reason. However, in extreme \\nemergency such a driver can be permitted to work the train with a pilot driver who is conversant w ith \\nthe road.  \\n \\n3. Road Knowledge Registers shall be maintained for all sections on which running staff \\nheadquartered at a particular shed are required to work trains. Separate registers should be opened \\nfor each individual section and each category of sta ff. The register should be in the following \\nproforma:  \\n \\nROAD KNOWLEDGE REGISTER  \\n(Section ... to ....)  \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \\nSNo.   Name of Driver/   Signature in   Date of  Signature  Signature  \\nAsstt Driver   token of   signature  of the   of TFR/  \\n(or Motorman)  possessing   Driving  ATFR  \\n     necessary   inspector  \\n     road know - \\n     ledge on  \\n     section concerned  \\n--------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \\n 1   2   3   4  5  6 \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- \\n \\n30616 Speed Restrictions  \\n \\n1. Drivers and Assistant Drivers must be fully conversant with permanent as well as temporary \\nspeed restrictions. Permanent speed restrictions are indicated in the working time table.  \\n \\n2.

Equ ipment  \\n \\nThe following equipment depending upon the type of locos will be issued to the Driver on taking \\nover a loco or may form part of loco equipments -  \\n \\ni) Loco Keys - BL Key, Panto Selection Key and, Reverser key  \\n \\nii)Portable Telephone  \\n \\niii) Hand br ush  \\n \\niv) Loco log  book  \\n \\n30620 Loco Log book  \\n \\n1. A separate log book is required to be maintained for each individual loco. It will be issued to the \\nDriver along with the tools of. the loco and will be returned by him to the Running office when \\nsigning o ff or handed over to the relieving Driver. The Log Book will have machine numbered pages.  \\n \\n2. For each trip the Driver should enter the following particulars -  \\n \\ni) Date  \\n \\nii)Train Number  \\n \\niii) From.................To. ................  \\n \\niv) Load of train  (in terms of vehicles)  \\n \\nV) Driver\\'s and Asstt. Driver\\'s name  \\n \\nVi)Brief description of unusual occurrence and failures, if any.  \\n \\nvii) Kilometre reading at the end of trip.  \\n \\nviii)Energy meter reading to be recorded if meters are provided,  \\n \\nix) Quantiti es of oil and lubricants added during inspections.  \\n \\n3. The details of repair carried out should be entered to by the PPO of the shed or the TFR/ ATFR \\nbefore the loco leaves the shed.  \\n \\n4. Running and Shed supervisors will also enter in the log book partic ulars of any item to be \\nspecially watched by the Driver.  \\n \\n5. At \\'0\\' hours on the last day of each month the corresponding kilometre reading should be entered \\nin the log book by the Driver if the loco is in service and by the shed/ depot supervisor if the loco is \\nunder repairs or is stabled.  \\n \\n6. Every time a loco is taken for the scheduled inspection, the type of inspection and the date on \\nwhich it is done should be entered in the log book by the PPO. PPO will similarly enter details of \\nunscheduled withdra wals of the loco for repairs, as well as particulars of modifications carried out.  \\n \\n7. Completed loco log books should be serially numbered for each loco and preserved in the \\nPlanning and Progress Office for a period of one year.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRA CTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [143]  8. Officers  and supervisors of the Rolling Stock section, during their cab inspections, will also record \\ntheir observations regarding performance of the loco in the log book.  \\n \\n30621 Driving Crew\\'s Pocket Books  \\n \\nEvery Driver and Assistant Driver will be provided with a pocket book to be carried by him while on \\nduty to enable Inspectors and Officers to record their observations regarding his working as noticed \\nby them during their cab inspections. This book should ha ve machine numbered pages. All entries \\nshould be in ink. Erasers or alteration of the entries made or tearing off of pages will be viewed as \\nserious misconduct by the crew.  \\n30622 Detailed Preparation of Locomotives  \\nThe operations listed for a particula r type of locomotive should be carried out in the sequence \\nindicated, every time a locomotive is taken over from a shed or from a stabling line. These \\noperations should be carried out from the driving cab. The preparation schedule presently adopted \\nis deta iled below.  \\n \\n1. Preliminary Check: Make sure that the loco is stabled on a wired track. Check the air reservoir \\ndrain cocks, and close if found open. In locos meant for multiple operation, check tightness of \\nelectrical couplers, air hose pipes and vacuum hose pipes and if standing on a pit he should carry \\nout under gear examination.  \\n \\n2. Energization of Control Circuit : Check the relay targets and condition of fuse -free breakers \\n(MCBs).  \\n \\nCheck the following:  \\ni) Battery voltage  \\n \\nii) After unlocking the lever box for auxiliary switches, see that the indication lamps for air blast \\ncircuit breaker (red), battery charging generator (green), tap changer (blue) reverser (yellow), \\nrectifier (white) and for wheel slip (red) are glowing and the tap changer notch indicator is in position \\n\\'0\\'. In some locos a push button is required to be pressed to check rectifier and wheel slip lamps. In \\nsome locos the pilot lamps have been replaced by LEDs. The driver should ensure that the \\ncorresponding LEDs are glowing.  \\n \\niii) That all fuses are in position on the fuse rack and/or all fuse -free breakers are switched \\'ON\\' and \\nspare fuses are in good condition.  \\n \\niv)That the earthing switch for control circuits is in \\'ON \\' position.  \\n \\nv)That the oil level of tap changer and transf ormer motor is normal.  \\n \\nvi)That the auxiliary isolating switches motor cut out switches and earth fault shunting switches are \\nnormal.  \\n \\nvii) That the drain cocks for air blast circuit breaker and pantographs are closed.  \\n \\nviii)That the isolating switch/is olating handle for tap -changer operation is normal.  \\n \\nix) That the earth -fault isolating switches for traction circuit and auxiliaries circuit and their relays are \\nin normal position and the switch for pressure relay for main circuit breaker is normal. If an isolating \\nswitch is not in the normal position, check the locomotive log book for any remarks in this respect \\nand report to the shed /depot.  \\n \\nx) Notice if any relay target shows red indication? lf so reset relay till white indication appears and \\nreport  to shed / depot.  \\n \\nxi)That the isolating switches for rectifier block are normal.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [144]  xii) That the position of Master Controller, Driver\\'s Vacuum Brake handle, Independent Brake Valve \\nhandle and Asst. driver\\'s brake valve handle are normal in rear cab.  \\n \\nxiii) That the oil levels in compressor(s) and exhausters are normal.  \\n \\n3. Examination of Loco Log Book:  When a Driver takes over a loco he shall checked entries in \\nthe log -book before star ting the train, and take note of remarks made during the last run and repairs \\ncarried out, and , whether he is required to keep a special watch.  \\n4. Traction Motor Cut Out :  If the log book shows that any traction motor has been isolated \\nduring the previous w ith, the Driver shall check the position of the isolating switch for that motor.  If \\nno mention of  repairs has been made, the matter shall be brought to the noticed of the shed \\nsupervisor. In regards to restrictions regarding working a loco with motor / m otors cut out, \\ninstructions given in the Operating Manual for the particular type of loco shall be followed .  \\n5. Compressed Air Supply: If the air pressure in the main reservoir is not sufficient, the battery \\noperated compressor  should be used to build up th e required pressure in the auxiliary reservoir. \\nOnce the pantograph is  raised, the circuit   breaker should be closed.  \\n \\n6. Closing of the Circuit Breaker: On closing the air blast circuit breaker, the auxiliary machines \\nshould start and the   indication lamp s or the corresponding LED for air blast circuit breaker (red) \\nand battery charger generator (green)   will be off. The main compressor should now be switched on \\nto charge the air reservoirs.  \\n \\n7. Starting of the Exhausters: With the Driver\\'s vacuum brake val ve on running/release \\nposition, switch on the      exhauster and check if 53 cm vacuum is built up when the hose pipe is \\nconnected to a disc with 8 mm  ,     (5/16\") hole.  \\n \\n8. Brake Test:  \\na) Hand Brake: Apply the hand brake hard and check if the brake blocks are effectively gripping the \\nright side wheels of the two front axles. Release the hand brakes and check that the brake blocks \\nare free.  \\n \\nb) Air Brake: Apply the Independent air brakes of the loco and ascertain whether the application of \\nthe brake is effective on all the wheels. This should be ensured by  physical examination of the \\neffective gripping of the brake blocks on the wheel tread. Check if the maximum brake cylinder \\npressure as indicated on the gauge is 3.5 kg/cm2 .Release the air  brake and check that the brakes \\nare released on all the wheels.  \\n \\nC) Vacuum Brake/Air Brake: The tests should be carried out after coupling with the train as per \\ninstructions laid down for the purpose (para 30623 and para 30625).  \\n \\n9. Blowers and Traction  Test:  \\n(i) Switch on the traction motor blowers and check their working and apply  independent loco brakes.  \\n \\n(ii)Set the reverser in forward position and ensure that yellow lamp goes off.  \\niii) If the white lamp or the corresponding LED for rectifier is extinguished indicating that there is no \\nfault on the rectifier system, notch forward by one notch and check if traction motor ammeter needle \\nmoves from zero and ensure that tap changer lamp (blue) is extinguished.  \\n(iv)Switch off master controller and re peat test for the other running direction.  \\n \\n(V)The blowers may now be switched off and air brakes be released after repeating the test for \\nreverse direction.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [145]  10. PantographTest :Check rais ing and lowering of the front and rear pantographs one after \\nanother, making use of the   selector switch. Finally keep the rear pantograph raised for normal \\noperation.  \\n \\n11. Quick Inspection of Mechanical and other parts  \\n \\nCheck the following:  \\ni) Operat ion of sanders and level of sand in sand boxes.  \\nii)Working of marker and headlights and flasher lights in both the cabs.  \\niii)Buffers and couplers  \\niv) Speed Recorder/Speedometer transmitter.  \\nv) Springs, dampers and other underframe mechanical parts and make sure there is no \\nabnormality.  \\n \\nvi) Oil level in gear cases, suspension bearings and pivot.  \\n \\n12 The testing of the locomotive shall be carried out from both cabs. He shall also ensure isolation \\nof isolating cocks of the brake of rear cab before m oving the locomotive.  \\n \\nNote:  \\n \\n1. When taking over a loco on which no repair or maintenance work has been carried out, \\ninspections in the sub -para 11 above may be omitted if time does not permit.  \\n \\n2. If the Driver notices some defect or abnormality likel y to affect the working of the loco, he shall \\nbring it to the notice of the Engine Examiner on duty.  \\n \\n30623 Check of Vacuum Before Starting  \\n \\n1. Based on the gradient and other factors in the section in which electric locos have to work each \\nZonal Railway  should issue instructions regarding the minimum vacuum that should be indicated In \\nthe loco and the Brake Van gauges. If the minimum prescribed vacuum is not obtained, the Driver \\nshall not start the train.  \\n \\n2. On attaching the locomotive to a train, if t he vacuum stipulated cannot be created and maintained \\nby the exhausters, the train should be examined by the train examining staff and leakages should \\nbe attended to so as to obtain the prescribed minimum vacuum before starting the train.  \\n \\n3. Other checks  of the vacuum brakes as laid down in General and Subsidiary Rules and in the \\nBrake Power Rules of the Zonal Railway shall also be carried out.  \\n \\n30624 Minimum Brake Power  \\n \\nThe running staff shall abide by all rules regarding the minimum brake power on th e goods and \\npassenger trains, issued by the Railways. For the purpose of working out the percentage brake \\npower, the \"piped\" vehicle should  be deemed to have inoperative cylinder/cylinders. An operative \\ncylinder is one in which the vacuum / pressure can b e created / destroyed by control from the \\nengine and which moreover satisfy the stipulation that its piston should remain up for not less than \\n20 minutes after the vacuum / pressure is destroyed.  \\n \\n30625 Operation of Air Braked Stock  \\n \\nFor operation of air  braked stock guidelines appear in the Annexure 6.01 to this Chapter.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III   [146]  \\n \\n 30626 Master Controller  \\n \\n1. The progression or regression from one traction notch to another (and similar progression o r \\nregression during braking in the case of locos with regenerative or rheostatic braking) is controlled \\nby the Master Controller from each driving cab. The Master Controller has two \\'stable\\' and two \\n\\'unstable\\' positions for traction notches as under:  \\n \\n0 (zero)  ......  Stable position  \\n \\n- (minus)  .......  Unstable position  \\n \\nN (neutral)  ........   Stable position  \\n \\n+ (Plus)  ..........   Unstable position  \\n \\nFirst release the mechanical locking of the Master Controller by moving the Reverser Controller to \\nForward or Reverse position. Then move the Master Controller to Neutral position. By moving the \\ncontroller momentarily to (+) and back to N, the tap changer would be notched by one step. Notch -\\nby-notch progression is effected by repeating this operation. In  a similar manner notch -by- notch \\nregression is possible by moving the Master Controller to ( -) and back to N.  \\n \\n2. A blue indicating lamp or the corresponding LED glows in the driving cab when the tap changer is \\nat \"0\". The position of the tap changer at any instant is indicated to the Driver by a Notch Indicator. It \\ntakes a few seconds (the exact time interval varying for different types of locos) for the tap changer \\nto return from full \\'on\\' to full \\'off\\' position when the Master Controller is switched of f. The blue lamp \\nre-lights when the tap changer has returned to \\' 0\\'.  \\n \\n30627 Use of Pantographs  \\n \\n1. The rear pantograph of the loco (in the direction of motion ) should normally be used by the \\nDriver.The leading pantograph may be used only if the rear pa ntograph is defective or damaged or \\nspecially instructed.  \\n \\n2. Loco should not be worked with both the pantographs raised.  \\n3. For normal lowering of pantographs the Master Controller should be switched off and the circuit \\nbreaker tripped before the panto -selector is moved to position \\'0\\'. In an emergency when the \\nlocomotive is in motion, the pantograph may be lowered by using the panto -selector switch, even \\nwithout tripping the circuit breaker but after bringing Master controller to \\'0\\' position.  \\n \\n30628 R egenerative and Rheostat Braking  \\n \\n1. The regenerative / rheostat braking is also controlled by the Master Controller. For braking, the \\nMaster Controller is moved in the opposite direction. The Master Controller positions corresponding \\nto such dynamic brak ing are -  \\n \\n(a) Stable positions  \\n \\n0 .............Common for traction and braking  \\n \\nP...........  Preparation for braking.  \\n \\nN ........   Neutral  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [147]  \\n \\n b) Unstable positions  \\n \\n+ (Plus)  ... Notch-by-notch progression during braking.  \\n \\n- (Minus)  ... Notch -by-notch regression during braking.  \\n \\nNotch -by-notch or continuous progression and regression are effected during braking, in the same \\nmanner as during traction, but using the above mentione d positions of the Master Controller.  \\n \\n30629 Starting of a Train  \\n1. The starting of a train is effected in two stages as under  \\n \\nIst stage   Initial starting  \\n2nd stage   Acceleration  \\n \\nWhen everything is ready for the train to start, set reverser handl e for the forward direction, switch \\non traction motor blower and progress the master controller notch by notch until the locomotive \\nstarts and moves forward with the train. During this period, keep an eye on the traction motor \\ncurrent to see that it is wit hin permissible limits. Watch particularly for any signs of slipping of \\nwheels. At the first sign of slipping notch back and press the sanders pedal and notch forward once \\nagain.               \\n \\n2. When accelerating from rest, the traction motors are liable  to be overloaded. Notch -by-notch \\nprogression of the tap -changers should be so controlled as not to exceed the overload (current and \\ntime) ratings of the traction motors laid down for each type  of loco. The permissible overload limits \\nare exhibited in eac h driving cab.  \\n \\n3. At the first available opportunity at the commencement of journey by a fresh crew, driver will test \\nthe brake power of the train. The test should be repeated wherever the load composition is altered.  \\n \\n30630 Starting on an Up -gradient  \\nWhen \"attacking\" an up -gradient, the Driver shall attain sufficiently high speed at the foot of the \\ngradient so as to enable him to negotiate the full length of the gradient without any stoppage en \\nroute, ensuring at the same time that the maximum permissi ble speed for that section is not \\nexceeded. If for any reason, the train comes to a stop on an up -gradient, the train shall first be held \\nfrom rolling down by the application of the pneumatic brakes. While re -starting, the following \\nsequence of operations shall be carried out -  \\n1. Apply  the independent air brakes on loco.  \\n \\n2. Release the vacuum brakes by using both exhausters for about 3 minutes initially followed by the \\nnormal running position of the vacuum brake valve for about 2 minutes.  \\n \\n.3. When th e brakes are almost fully released the train will tend to roll back giving a slight jerk on the \\nloco. Just then notch forward 2 to 4 steps, simultaneously releasing the independent loco brakes (as \\nlaid down in the Operating Manual for the type of loco) so that the locomotive starts hauling the \\ntrailing load. Use sanders as required to improve adhesion.  \\n \\n4. Particular care should be taken to prevent sudden jerks due to excessive acceleration.  \\n \\n5. Continue notching forward as far as adhesion will permit and  without exceeding the prescribed \\nlimits of current, observing the precautions during initial starting (para 30629 - sub para 2).  \\n \\n5. If the locomotive is not able to pull the load, the Driver shall apply independent air brakes \\nand make a fresh start. If this  too fails he shall take appropriate steps as laid down in General Rules \\nand Subsidiary Rules.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill    [148]  \\n 30631 Speed control  \\nOnce the current drawn falls below the continuous rated current, speed may  be regulated by \\nnotching forward or backward so as to catch up with the \"deserving notch\" necessary to meet \\nservice conditions, The aim should be to maintain the speed as close to, but never exceeding the \\nmaximum permissible speed over each section. After  the maximum voltage has been reached, \\nspeed control can also he effected by using the field shunting controller.  \\nField Weakening Switch  : After the maximum voltage for the motor has been attained, field \\nweakening may be effected if it is necessary to rai se the speed further. This is done by operating \\nthe \\'Shunting Lever\\'. Care must be taken to see that sufficient time is allowed for train to accelerate \\nbefore going to the next step. The current ratings prescribed for each type of loco should not be \\nexceed ed. Too fast a rate of field weakening could cause a flashover of traction motors and should \\nnot, therefore, be attempted.  \\n \\n30632 Operation of the Reverser for Braking  \\nOperation of the reverser to stop a train when the loco is in motion is strictly forbi dden.  \\n30633 Manual Control of the Tap Changer  \\n1. Provision exists in all the locomotives for manual operation of the tap changer, should normal \\nelectrical operation through the Master Controller fail. In some locomotives, manual control is \\npossible from  the driving cab itself. In some others manual operation has to be done by the \\nAssistant Driver in the corridor in response to signals from the Driver. In some types of locos, in \\naddition to manual control through the Master Controller, separate electrical  push -button control is \\nalso provided.  \\n2. The manual control located in the corridor should be used only to clear the block section and if \\ndirected by TLC, the driver can go to the nearest loco changing point. The loco should be withdrawn \\nfrom service at the earliest opportunity.  \\n30634 Slowing down and Stopping  \\n \\nDepending upon local conditions, Railways may issue local instructions indicating a given stopping \\npoint identified by a board / OHE mast etc. in the event a particular signal ahead at danger. T he \\ndriver should follow these instructions. While slowing down and stopping the following guidelines \\nmay be observed.  \\n \\n1. Before a scheduled stop or an unscheduled stop which can be anticipated by the Driver, coasting \\nshould be resorted to the maximum ext ent possible, taking into account the gradient of the section.  \\n \\n2. Before application of brakes, the Master Controller should be in the \"OFF\" position and the tap -\\nchanger should have returned to \\'0\\' notch as indicated by glowing of the blue pilot lamp or the \\ncorresponding LED. In locomotives fitted with regenerative or rheostatic braking, the electrical \\nbrakes should be made use of to the maximum extent possible.  \\n \\nHowever if the driver is  negotiating the down gradient, he can apply loco brakes till he pre pares for \\nregenerative/ rheostatic braking to keep his train under control, if necessary.  \\n \\n3. After a stop, the blowers for traction motors and transformer should continue to run for 15 minutes \\nespecially after long runs with heavy trains to cool the moto rs.  \\n \\n4. The place and duration of stop permitting, the Driver or Assistant Driver shall check the following:  \\n \\na) Axle box, traction motor and gear box bearing temperature (by feeling). In case the running staff \\nobserves abnormal temperature, he will repo rt the matter to TLC for suitable action. TLC will \\narrange its checking through maintenance staff at the appropriate point.  \\n \\nb) Working of all blowers.  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL –VOLUEME III    [149]  \\n c)  Oil level of main transformer and  tap changer and temperature of main transformer whenever \\npossible.  \\n \\nThe air reservoirs shall also be drained off to expel accumulated water.  \\n30635 Locos in Multiple Operation  \\n1. Some series of locomotives are designed for multiple operation of two, three or four locos. This \\nwill be indicated in the Instruction Manual of each type of locomotive. The condition of the apparatus \\non the leading and trailing locos, the electrical and pneumatic connections to be made between the \\nlocos and all other details of preparation of the locos for multiple operation shall be in accordance \\nwith detailed instructions for each type of loco. Similarly the driving and other instructions for the \\nindividual types of locos as laid down should be followed.  \\n \\n2. Differences in wheel diameters of different locos in a multiple consists will be within the \\ntolerances specified and the consist will be treated as a single unit for operation purposes.  \\n \\n3. In case of failure and break down of a loco in a consist the entire consist shou ld normally be \\nwithdrawn from services.  \\n \\n4. One important check to be exercised by the Driver when operating locos in a multiple unit is to \\nverify that the pantographs of the rear locos respond to the lower/raise operation, when negotiating \\nsections where  the pantographs are required to be lowered and subsequently raised.  \\n \\n5. Coupling of locos  \\na) All the hose pipes i.e. brake pipe (BP), feed pipe, Vacuum hose pipe, Main reservoir (MR) \\nequalizing pipe and brake cylinder (BC) equalizing hose pipes should be connected between the \\nlocos and the angle cocks are fully opened. The angle cocks of outer ends of MR and BC equalizing \\nangle cocks are kept closed in addition to BP & FP angle cocks of front end.  \\n \\nb) The three electrical jumpers on one side only shoul d be connected between the locos. The auto \\nbrake valve handles (A9) and independent brake valve handles (SA9) should be kept at \"Release\" \\nposition in all the cabs but the cut -out cocks must be kept open in driving cab only. The cocks in all \\ncabs in each lo co must be kept closed. The isolating cock (A -8) should be kept in lead position \\n(open) in leading loco and trail position (closed) in all the trailing locos. The position of MU2B Valve \\nshould be \"Lead\" on leading loco and \"Trail\" on all the trailing locos .  \\n \\nThe compressors may be put in service as per requirement depending upon the number of wagons \\nof the train. Care should be taken to put at least one compressor in service in each of the trailing \\nlocos.  \\n \\n6. Energizing of Multiple Units  \\n \\nThe battery swi tch of all the locos should be put ON and the air pressure built up in emergency \\nreservoir of each loco. The pantograph of all the locos may be raised and circuit breaker should be \\nclosed from leading loco. The compressors of all the locos should be starte d.  \\n \\n7. Precaution while changing driving cab   \\n \\nThe changing of Cab means the changing of driving loco. Care should he taken to change the, \\nposition of cut. Out cocks of A9 and SA9 Lead and Trail Cocks and MU2B valve while changing the \\ndriving cab.  \\n \\n8. Loco Faults  \\n \\nIt is possible that a fault may develop in any of the locos in Multiple Operation. It may be detected \\nwith help of  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [150]  six pilot lamps and two additional lamps. A lamp in the ceiling of  the Cab called \"LSGRT\" (group \\nloco lamp) glows only on the faulty loco. The other lamp provided on driving desk called \"LSOL\" \\n(other loco lamp) glows in good loco indicated that the fault is in other loco. When fault is diagnosed \\non a particular loco, it is necessary that the train is stopped on a station and the remedial action is \\ntaken on the faulty loco. In case the fault can not be removed and it is not possible to keep the faulty \\nloco in service, it should be made dead to run as a vehicle.  \\n \\n30636 Dou ble Heading  \\n1.  Operation of a train with two locos in front ,both coupled together and to the train ,but \\noperated independently by separate crew is known as double -heading. The two locos can be of \\ndifferent types.  \\n2.  Subject to compliance With all sp eed restrictions,the maximum speed of a double headed \\ntrain shall not exceed the lower of the maximum speeds of the two locos individually.  \\n3.  Each loco must be manned by a Driver and Assistant Driver who are qualified to work the \\ntype of loco and have learned the road over which the train is working. The driver of the leading \\nloco, known as the \"Train Driver\" must be qualified to work the class of train and will be responsible \\nfor working the train in accordance with rules.  \\n \\n4.  It is the duty of the l eading Driver to satisfy himself that the exhauster of the second loco, if \\nrunning, is suitably isolated from the train pipe and does not create vacuum in the train pipe. Except \\nin an emergency, the leading Driver only will apply the brakes. Under no circu mstances may the \\nsecond Driver release the brakes on his loco or the train or apply the brakes independently on his \\nloco.  \\n5. When starting power may be applied by both locos as required. The leading Driver who is in \\ncharge of the train will notch up until t he train moves. The rear Driver will assist as required.  \\n6. While running, power may be applied as often as necessary but gradually by the rear Driver.  \\n7 The rear Driver may switch off power using his discretion and with due regard to locality, \\ngradient et c. The rear Driver must frequently observe his vacuum gauge and be prepared to stop.  \\n8.  It is the duty of the train Driver to ascertain that the second Driver is acquainted with the \\ncontents of all caution orders and special instructions etc. which he m ay receive while working the \\ntrain.  \\n9.  Instructions issued by local Railways regarding coordination amongst the two crews should \\nbe followed.  \\n10. All rules in regard to switching off power at neutral section, lowering of pantograph in the \\nevent of eme rgency feeding etc. shall be observed. The Driver of the rear locomotive will be \\nsignalled by the Driver in the leading locomotive to carry out these operations, as required, by \\nmeans of code whistles. The code to be used for such occasions shall be laid d own under local \\ninstructions.  \\n \\n30637 Banking  \\n \\n1. On a gradient sections, sometimes banking locos are used in the rear of the train to assist the \\nleading loco/ locos to negotiate the gradient. The banking locomotive, must be coupled to the train.  \\n \\nThe va cuum hose/air brake pipes of the banking loco should be coupled to the last vehicle, but on \\nno account should the exhauster of the banking loco be run. In the event of banking air braked \\ntrains, MUZ 8  valve of banking loco shall be kept in trail poistion.  The Driver of the banking loco will \\nkeep a watch on the vacuum gauge and take necessary action to assist the leading Driver when \\nbrakes are applied.  \\n \\n2. All rules in regard to switching off power at neutral section, lowering of pantograph in the event of  \\nemergency feeding etc. shall be observed. The Driver of the rear locomotive will be signalled by the \\nDriver in the leading locomotive to carry out these operations, as required, by means of code \\nwhistles. The code to be used for such occasions shall be la id down under local instructions.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [151]  \\n \\n 3. When working a train up a gradient with the assistance of an electric banking loco, the following \\nprocedure should be followed.  \\na)     When the signal  is lowered the leading Driver will give the prescribed code whistle. The \\nbanking Driver will acknowledge the whistle and notch up quickly so as to obtain the maximum \\npermissible starting current, simultaneously releasing the loco brakes. The sanders shoul d be used \\nto avoid wheel slipping.  \\nb)     The leading driver should take 2 to 3 notches, releasing the loco brakes simultaneously and \\nusing the sanders as required.  \\n \\nc) The leading and banking Drivers should keep a watch on their respective ammeters and maintain \\nthe current at the continuous rating.  \\nd) If a \"Stop\" signal is encountered in the gradient section by the leading Driver, he should switch off \\nthe Master Controller and bring the train to a stop applying the brakes to the extent required. He will  \\nalso use code whistle for the banking driver. This will increase current in the banking loco. The \\nbanking loco driver should regress the Master Controller so as to maintain the current at the \\ncontinuous rated value till  the train stops. On stopping, both  the leading and banking Drivers should \\napply independent air brakes to avoid rolling down.  \\n \\ne) When re -starting after a stop signal, the same procedure as in (a), (b) and (c) should be followed.  \\n \\nf) At the point where the rising gradient ends, the Banki ng Driver should switch \\'off\\' the Master \\nController and stop pushing. A board is provided to indicate this point.  \\n \\n30638 Inability to Haul Goods Trains - Stalling  \\n \\nThe most common causes for inability of electric locos to haul goods trains are as under : -  \\n1.   Inclement weather can result in poor adhesion. Some sections on Indian Railways during \\nautumn season in forest areas are subject to track being covered by semi -dry leaves which turn into \\na wet paste by movement of wheels and is a serious cause for failure of adhesion.  \\n2.   Passage of salt laden trains with leaking wagons can also affect the adhesion.  \\n3.   The total trailing load exceeds the permissible load for the type of loco, either due to increased \\nnumber of wagons or due to the cumulative eff ect of excess loading of a number of individual \\nwagons.  \\n4. The drag caused by brake -binding on rakes equipped with vacuum brakes which may be due to \\none or more of the following causes.  \\na) Trains hauled by diesel locos sometimes have a high degree of va cuum. An electric loco \\nsubsequently attached may not be able to create as much vaccum. Unless every cylinder is \\nmanually released, some brake binding will occur.  \\nb) Many forms of temporary expediencies are used to reduces leaks while forming a load. The load \\nmay thus start initially with a good vacuum. The various methods used to prevent leakage may give \\nway on the run and the brakes may begin to bind.  \\nc) Initially the brakes may be released fully by working both exhausters. If, however, there are leaks  \\nin the train line, the vacuum is lost gradually as soon as normal single exhauster working is \\nresumed.  \\n30639 Heavy Haul Trains  \\nSuch are the trains which can not be accommodated in the existing loops of the section. Railways \\noperating such trains will issue special instructions and the driving crews should be made familiar \\nwith various problems anticipated to be countered with such operation. Some of these trains may \\nhave locomotive/locomotives sandwiched in between.. Their operation too will call for s pecial set of \\ninstructions.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [152]   \\n30640 Neutral sections  \\n \\nIt is essential to switch off power of locomotives when passing through a neutral section to prevent \\nthe possibility of arcing at the OHE a nd possible damage to it. To ensure this following boards are \\nprovided on the OHE masts (Refer Chapter II - Vol.I).  \\ni)     500 m warning board - Be alert and ensure main reservoir pressure is at maximum limit. Close \\ndirect switch for compressor if necessa ry.  \\nii)    250 m warning board - Master controller to be brought to zero and ensure that the glowing of \\nBlue lamp for tap changer. Get ready to open the circuit breaker.  \\niii)   Open circuit breaker board - open circuit breaker before passing the board an d ensure that \\nglowing of red lamp for circuit breaker. If the circuit breaker does not trip at \"Open Circuit Board\" the \\npanto must be lowered immediately.  \\n \\n2. After passing through the neutral section, the Driver should close the circuit breaker at the \"c lose \\ncircuit breaker\" board and resume normal working thereafter.  \\n \\n3. As a normal rule the train should coast through a neutral section. However, if for some reason it \\nbecomes necessary to stop the train in the vicinity of a neutral section, the Driver mu st try his best \\nto stop the locomotive after crossing the neutral section. Only in an emergency or to avert an \\naccident, may the locomotive be brought to rest within the neutral section. If a locomotive comes to \\na stop within the neutral section and the tr ain cannot restart, special arrangements will have to be \\nmade to push or pull it by means of another locomotive.  \\n \\n4. Before tripping the circuit breaker at a neutral section, the main compressor should be worked \\n\"direct\" for some time to build up enough p ressure in the reservoir, otherwise there is possibility that \\nthe air -blast circuit breaker may fail to reclose after passing the neutral section due to low pressure.  \\n \\n5. If the speed of the train while approaching a neutral section is 30 km/h, the Master  Controller \\nshould not be switched off at the 250 m board. Power may be kept on till the circuit breaker is \\ntripped at the \"open circuit\" board.  \\n \\n6. Passing a Neutral Section with Multiple Loco Unit  \\nThe bipolar Switch BSLN provided in driving cab to ope n the circuit breaker and to lower the \\npantograph of trailing locos, should be put on at 250 m warning board after putting master controller \\nto 0. The circuit breaker of leading loco may be opened at open CB board with the help of BLDJ. \\nAfter passing the N eutral Section the circuit breaker of leading loco should be closed first and then \\nBLSN should be put off. The pantos of trailing locos will make contact within 10 sec. circuit breakers \\nof trailing locos may now be closed and traction resumed.  \\n \\n7. Short N eutral Section  \\n \\nIn such a section both the pantographs should not be raised under any condition.  \\n30641 lowering Pantographs Under Emergency Feed  \\nWhen power supply from one substation is interrupted and feed is extended from the adjacent \\nsubstations, i t will be necessary for the Driver to lower the pantograph at least 2 or 3 spans before \\narriving at the overlap span opposite the substation which is out of operation. Such an eventuality \\nmay also arise when some portion of  \\n OHE is defective. When any of s uch contingencies arise the Drivers are advised by a \"Caution \\nOrder\" either at the starting point or through Station Masters enroute. Where this restriction is to be \\nobserved emergency \"lower pantograph\" and “ raise pantograph\" boards may be provided (Chap ter \\nII - Vol. I).  \\n30642 Unwired Tracks  \\n1. In station and goods yards only certain tracks are equipped with OHE. Special sign -boards \\nare exhibited at  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME III   [153]  points where unwired tracks take off from  wired tracks. Drivers/Motormen should keep a careful \\nlookout for unwired tracks when entering or running through stations and goods yards. Should per \\nchance an electric train be signalled erroneously to enter an unwired track, the Driver should stop \\nshort  of the turnout and draw the attention of the cabin. Drivers should also report such cases with \\ndetails to the TLC immediately.  \\n \\n2. If in case a Driver notices that he is going on an unwired track and cannot stop, he should lower \\nthe pantographs immediate ly. This will minimize damage to the pantographs.  \\n \\n30643 Coasting Down -gradients  \\n1. Drivers are expected to be well conversant with the road and to make the best use of down -\\ngradients to effect maximum possible saving in energy consumption.  \\n \\n2. In level  sections and particularly in suburban sections, coasting should be resorted to as much as \\npossible and brakes applied only when essential to control the speed or to stop the train. To help \\nDrivers \"coasting boards\" are fixed in some sections.  \\n \\n3. In undu lating country, speed may be allowed to drop down when going up a short up -gradient. \\nAfter passing over the crest, the train will automatically pick up speed with power off on the other \\nside when going down -hill, so that it attains maximum permissible spee d on the section when it \\narrives at the foot of the next -up-gradient. This feature should receive special emphasis during \\nlearning the road period.  \\n \\n4. When going down a long, steep gradient, brake shoes are liable to get very hot and in these \\ncircumstanc es, brake power will be reduced. With the reduction of brake power, speed may rise to \\ndangerous levels. To prevent this possibility, Drivers are required to maintain the speed within the \\nlimits prescribed and sometimes even to halt a train at certain point s to prevent the possibility of a \\nrun away speed and consequent serious accidents. Drivers are required to adhere strictly to \\nstanding instructions issued by local authorities in this regard.  \\n \\n30644 Loco Running Light  \\n \\nBefore starting a light loco the Dr iver should personally verify that the loco brake isolating valves are \\nclosed in rear and open in the driving cab. When a loco is run light; the free ends of the vacuum \\ncoupling hose pipe shall be secured firmly to the dummy and one of the exhausters may b e kept \\nworking. The driver should, however, satisfy himself that the air -brakes on the loco are effective. He \\nshould normally stop the loco during light run by independent air -brake valve, but the Assistant \\nDriver may apply the brakes by operating emergenc y brake valve, if the situation warrants.  \\n \\n30645 Wheel Skidding  \\n \\nWheel skidding in locomotive takes place whenever braking force exceeds the limit of adhesion. \\nThe braking force could be higher due to incorrect setting of automatic brake valve, independe nt \\nbrake valve and pressure limiting valve or due to malfunctioning of proportionate valve, distributor \\nvalve and C2 relay valve. This can also however happen if the pressure gauges are not calibrated \\nproperly.  \\n \\nWheel skidding is also noticed under advers e adhesion conditions caused by oil and grease on rail \\ntable, wet rails and falling of tree leaves and salt on the tracks. Poor brake power of the train can \\nalso result in wheel skidding of the locomotive, in certain condition.  \\n \\nTo avoid wheel skidding, i t is necessary to maintain the brake equipment in perfect working order \\nand ensure setting of equipments at designed value. Locomotive brake should be applied \\njudiciously. In case the poor brake power of the train is observed by the Driver, he should advis e \\ncontrol for joint checking and corrective action as laid down in Operating Manual and ensure \\npressing of PVEF switch while applying train brakes.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [154]  \\n \\n Annexure 6.01  \\nOPERATION OF AIR BRAK ED STOCK  \\n1.0 Operation  \\n \\nThe running of air braked stock is subject to the following stipulations:  \\n1. 1 Electric Loco used for hauling air braked stock have the provision of IRAVB -2 (twin pipe) \\ngraduated release air brake system.  \\n1.2 Before attaching locomotives to trains, the engine should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is \\nfree from any leakage and the valves are in working order.  \\nThe A -9 valve should be set at 5 ± 0. 1 kg / cm2 and effectively sealed. The flow meter should be in \\nworking ord er.  \\n1.3 Procedure for Checking Capability of Locomotive Compressors for Charging/Releasing of Train \\nBrakes  \\n \\nN.B.: This test should be carried out on single locomotive if only one locomotive is used for hauling \\nthe train or on the foremost loco of a cons ist of locomotives, unless otherwise stated.  \\n \\n1.3.1 Place the Driver\\'s automatic brake valve handle in emergency position.  \\n \\n1.3.2  Start the locomotive compressors for building up of main reservoir pressure.  \\n \\n1.3.3  Allow the main reservoir pressure to build up to th e maximum stipulated limits for the \\nparticular type of locomotive.  \\n \\n1.3.4  Close the angle cock for the brake pipe, couple 7.5 mm diameter leak hole special test \\ncoupling    \\n          fabricated to RDSO design with the brake pipe coupling of the locomotiv e.

The drop in MR, \\nFP  \\n pressure should not be more than 0. 3 kg/cm2in 4 min.  \\nb)     With independent brake applied in full, shut down the compressors. The drop in MRFP and \\nbrake pipe pressure sh ould not be more than 0.3 kg/cm2 in 4 min.  \\nc)     With both independent and auto brake released, shut down the compressors. The drop in \\nMRFP and BP pressure should not be more than 0.3 kg/cm2 in 4 min.  \\n \\n1.5   Procedure for checking the leakage rate of th e air brake system without Auxiliaries in the circuit  \\n \\n1.5.1 Charge the system fully with MR pressure charged to 10 kg/cm2 . Keep the brakes in released \\nposition.  \\n \\n1.5.2 Shut down the compressors. Close the isolating cock of panto circuit line C -6 and BA panels \\nisolating cock C20 on the wind screen wipers and the horn circuit. The drop in pressure in any of the \\ncircuits should not exceed 0.2 kg/cm2   in 4 min.  \\n \\n1.6 Procedure for checking the leakage in BP circuit   \\n \\n1.6.1 Charge the system fully Make 0.6 k g/c m2 reduction in BP by automatic brake valve. Close \\nisolating cock A 15 in BP control line (Lead/trial cock). The pressure drop in BP should not exceed \\n0.7 Kg/ c m2 in 5 minutes.  \\n \\n1.6.2 Charge the system fully. Make 0.6 kg/c m2 reduction in BP pressure  by automatic brake valve. \\nClose isolating cock A -8 provided near the BP charging C -2 relay valve A -31 (locomotive nominated \\nfor long haul operation have this provision). The pressure drop in BP shall not be more than 0.7 Kg/ \\ncm2 in 5 minute.  \\n \\n1. 7 Proced ure and checking to leakage in FP circuit   \\n1.7.1 Charge the system fully with FP charged to 6 Kg / cm2 . Close isolating cock A -21 provided \\nbefore the feed valve A -52. The pressure drop in feed pipe should not exceed 0.7 kg/cm2 in 5 \\nminute.  \\n1. 8 Starting  of Train   \\n1.8.1 Blow off the angle cocks before coupling to expel dust etc.  \\n1.8.2 Check the position of angle cocks of air hoses of the leading and trailing locomotives and of \\nthe first wagon of the load.  \\n \\n1.8.3 Ensure that the brake pipe and the feed pipe connections are not mixed up either between two \\nlocomotives or between the locomotive and the first wagon of the load.  \\n \\n1.8.4 Ensure that brakes of the train are fully released by TXR otherwise while starting skidding or \\neven breakage of coupling wil l occur. At non -TXR stations this job has to be done by the Driver.  \\n \\n1.8.5 Ensure that BP gauge in the loco is showing 5 + 0.1 kg/c m2 and FP gauge is showing 6 kg/c \\nm2 and then after ensuring the continuity of air pressure sign the brake power certificat e jointly with \\nthe TXR. Do not disturb the setting of A -9 valve under any circumstances.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [156]  \\n 1.8.6 In the flow indicator gauge, set the red needle to coincide with the white needle after the  \\nneedle has established. Do not disturb the red needle thereafter, through -out the run.  \\n1.8.7 Move one engine length to get a feel of the train. Thereafter start the train smoothly.  \\n1.9 While on Run  \\n1.9.1 As far as possible, the train should be stopp ed only by minimum application of brakes. In other \\nwords, full service application or over reduction or emergency application should be used in genuine \\nemergency only, and not in normal circumstances, as otherwise heavy braking force will result in \\nskiddin g and excessive wear of wheels. After over reduction or emergency application, to have the \\nbrakes fully released, wait for 3 to 4 minute.  \\n \\n1.9.2 If the train is running heavy, stop immediately and investigate the cause. Any delay in \\ninvestigation may caus e skidding of wagon wheels or other damages.  \\n \\n1.9.3 CBC of loco and wagons can break due to high coupler force which can arise either while \\nstopping, starting or accelerating. To avoid breakage of couplers, therefore, instructions regarding \\napplication o f brakes given herein should be followed rigidly.  \\n \\n1.9.4 In case of heavy leakage or mal -functioning of distributor valve (if brake binding is noticed) pull \\nthe quick release valve lever of the distributor valve of the wagon. In case brake binding problem  is \\nrepeated, the DV of the concerned wagon should be isolated by putting the isolating cock handle to \\noff position and the quick release valve of DV pulled till the brakes are fully released.  \\n \\n1.9.5 In case of disconnection of air hose enroute, attention  be given by closing the angle cocks and \\nif necessary by replacing air hose by removing from either the front end of loco or rear end of the \\nbrake van. After this is done and the air hoses are correctly coupled, the angle cocks should be \\nopened and the sys tem fully charged, brakes released and the train started as mentioned in para \\n1.8.  \\n \\n1.9.6 The braking technique shall be as under: - Minimum application / release / minimum \\napplication / release. A series of minimum application/ release operations should b e done for \\ncontrolling the train.  \\n \\n1.9.7  After stop, even with minimum application wait for two minutes before restarting. Start only \\nafter the white needle on the flow -meter coincides with red needle.  \\n \\n1.9.8 Report all problems and unusual events notice d on run in respect of air brake functioning and \\nwagon movement etc. to TXR concerned.  \\n \\n1.10 Brake Binding on run  \\n \\n1.10.1 lf during run the train comes to a halt and brake binding is observed, sound locomotive horn \\nwith a whistle code prescribed for alar m chain pulling. This will give an indication to the Guard that \\nthe train is held up due to brake binding and the Guard should take action as prescribed for him.  \\n \\n1.10.2 If the locomotive is fitted with an air -flow indicator locating the trouble is easier , Check as \\nfollows - \\n \\nIf the white needle has moved up only slightly, it indicates leakage in the train brake pipe, source of \\nleakage should be traced. If the white needle moves by a big margin, it indicates heavy discharge of \\nair from the brake pipe. This could be due to an angle cock in front of a wagon being closed. It could \\nalso be due to a disconnected brake pipe or a burst hose pipe.  \\n \\n1.10.3 If there is no flow indicator, look carefully at the brake pipe pressure gauge. Originally the \\npressure should have been 5 kg /c m2 on the locomotive and minimum of 4. 8 kg /c m2 in the brake \\nvan. If at the time of occurrence the pressure is less than the original value, this could. be due to \\nadditional leakage in the train brake pipe or train  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC  TRACTION MANUAL –VOLUME III    [157]  \\n  parting. The driver shall therefore ensure that his full train is intact, otherwise take action as if  train \\nparting has occurred.  \\n \\n1.10.4 If there is brake binding but no drop of BP pressure, it could be due to rear angle cock of a \\nwagon being closed.  \\n \\n1.10.5  Examine the train along with guard to find out the cause of brake binding. If the brake \\nbinding is  due to a closed angle cock, open the angle cock fully.  \\n \\nIf any distributor valve is defective, isolate th e same and release the brakes of that wagon and \\nrecord the same in the train journal as well as on the brake certificate.  \\n \\nIf the leakage is due to a burst hose pipe (which is very rear), release the brakes in rear of the burst \\npipe after closing the rear  angle cock of the last unaffected wagon and clear the block section \\ncautiously at a slow speed with partial brake power.  \\n \\nAfter obtaining Guard\\'s observations and taking corrective action, record on the journal and also \\nreport the problem to the section c ontroller indicating the wagon number affected.  \\n \\n1.10.6  In case, the leakage or cause of brake binding is not located, destroy the brake pipe \\npressure completely through A9 close the angle cocks of the loco, release the brake of the complete \\ntrain and work the t rain as non -braked, cautiously at a slow speed to clear the block section.  \\n \\n1.11  Stopping of a Train  \\n \\n1.11.1   Braking technique to be observed should be as detailed in sub -para 1. 9.  \\n \\n1 11.2  Stopping of train should be smooth ( without jerks) which is to be done by releasing the \\nbrakes just before final step.  The handle of drivers brake valve  should be put to release position \\nwhen the speed is about 5km/h prior to stopping.  \\n \\n1.11.3 When  stopping at a station on a down grade, the dynamic brakes be kep t in ON position and \\nshould only be cut off after the application of independent brakes.  \\n2.0 Action to be Taken in Case of Loco Failure with Air Braked Stock  \\n \\n1. During double headed operation, if the rear loco fails, the train is to be worked by the leadin g \\nloco and the block section cleared.  If, the load cannot be cleared by one loco, assistance is to be \\ngiven by any other loco, preferably from rear, only for the purpose of clearing the block section.  But \\nwhen the block section is being cleared by a loco  equipped with vacuum brakes, the loco driver has \\nto be extra cautious to stop the train at the stop signal.  \\n2. During double headed operation, if the leading loco fails, the train is to be stopped, isolation \\ncock A8 in the brake pipe charging line and MU2B i n the trailing loco are to be put to normal position \\nin order to feed the BP pressure to the load and application of brakes from the rear loco and the \\nblock section cleared in the same manner as explain in sub -para above.  \\n3. In the event of non -availability o f loco fitted with air brakes (either electric or diesel) the \\nbrakes of the entire rake have to be released in the block section and an ordinary loco (vacuum \\nbraked) attached to clear the block section.  In this event, the train is to be worked at a restri cted \\nspeed of 15km/h as it shall be controlled only by the loco brakes.  This load is to be received on the \\nmain line.  If it is not possible to receive the train on the main line, it should be received on the loop \\nline, provided the trailing end of the lo op is set for the main line, so that in case of loss of control, the \\ntrain does not get derailed on the trap point or goes in to the sand hump.  \\n4.  In the event of failure of both the locos and non -availability of a loco fitted with air -brake the train \\ncan be   worked with an unmodified Diesel or electric loco, at a restricted speed of 15 km/h.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS -AC TRACTION MANUAL -VOLUME III    [158]  \\n  \\n CHAPTER VII  \\nOPERATION OF EMUs  \\n \\n30700    Duties of Motor Man  \\n \\n1.

The M otorman taking over an EMU train will carry out checks as detailed below when – \\n \\n(a) a train is taken over from and EMU shed or stabling line after maintenance or inspection ;  \\n(b) a train is taken over for its first trip of the day or after stabling at a station siding for more \\nthan one hour.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS – AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOL III     [160]  2. The duties prescribed in the paras mentioned above for the Motorman will  devolve on the \\nShunters or Engine Turners when the train is wor ked by a Shunter or Engine Turner from the shed \\nor stabling line to the station platform and the Motorman takes over the train on the platform. The \\njoint brake test prescribed in para 30708 shall, however, be carried out only by the Motorman who \\nworks the first trip.  \\n \\n3. Instructions given in this section are of a general nature applicable to all types of EMUs and \\nshould be treated as complementary / supplementary to detailed instructions issued by respective \\nrailways for each class of EMUs.  \\n \\n30703 Prelim inary Checks  \\nThe Motorman should -  \\na) check that the entire train is on a wired track so that by inadvertent raising of the pantograph on \\nan unwired track, no damage is caused.  \\nb) he is in possession of the correct set of keys for operation of the rever ser, control switch, \\npantograph selector switch and doors and  \\nc) go through the defects register to acquaint himself with the defects noted earlier and the action \\ntaken by the maintenance staff to set right such defects.  \\n \\n30704 Checks Before Starting Tra ins  \\n \\n1. In the entire train the Motorman will  check the following : -  \\n \\na) that the coaches are mechanically coupled properly and the electrical/pneumatic/vacuum \\nconnections between coaches are correctly made;  \\n \\nb) that all the drain cocks are closed and p neumatic isolating cocks are in normal position   \\n \\nc) that the intermediate driving cabs not in  use are properly locked;  \\n \\nd) at the ends of the train the pneumatic and vacuum (wherever applicable) pipes and electrical \\ncouplers are correctly placed in the d ummy sockets and dummy hooks respectively;  \\n \\ne) the headlights, tail lights, marker lights, head -codes and tag -boards are in order;  \\n \\nf) hand -brakes are released;  \\n \\ng) that fire extinguishers and alarm resetting rods are available.  \\n \\n2. In each motor coach  he shall check that : -  \\n \\na) none of the overload relays are in tripped position;  \\n \\nb) all fuses are in order and fuse -free breakers are \"ON\",  \\n \\nc) all traction motors are cut in for normal service;  \\n \\nd) the control cut -out and battery switches are \"ON\" an d battery voltage is  normal;  \\n \\ne) the cut -out switches for pneumatic governors are in normal position;  \\n \\nf) the transformer oil level is normal;  \\n \\ng) the main earth switch is \"OFF\" and interlock keys are in the proper position.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRA CTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [161]   \\n3.In the leading driving cab i.e. the driving cab to be used for the first trip, check that  \\n \\na) all fuses are in position and fuse free breakers are \",ON\";  \\n \\nb) the deadman\\'s device is functioning normally;  \\n \\nc) wiper , hooter, headlight (including emergency headlight) , head code light and tail light( including \\nemergency tail light) are functioning correctly;  \\n \\nd) the main reservoir and brake pipe pressures are normal;  \\n \\ne) all  indicating instruments are normal.  \\n4. In addition motorman will conduct checks for each type  of EMU as required in the respective \\nOperating Manuals.  \\n \\n30705 Familiarity with automatic brake application  \\nIn EMUs provided with electro -pneumatic and automatic brakes, normally the braking system made \\nuse of by the Motorman for service stops is the electro -pneumatic system. Though primarily meant \\nfor use in emergency and for automatic application in the event of train parting, the automatic air \\nbrakes are capable of graduated application for servic e stopping of EMU trains. This graduated \\napplication of automatic brakes, however, requires some practice on the part of motormen. Once \\nduring every trip they should, therefore, control the train and bring it to a stop making use of the \\nautomatic brakes. I n the event of failures of electro -pneumatic brakes it will be quite safe to keep the \\nunits in service using the automatic brake system till the train can be conveniently withdrawn from \\nservice.  \\n \\n30706 Dead Man\\'s Handle   \\n1. Since an Electrical Multiple U nit train is operated by a motorman alone, it is necessary to provide \\nmeans of applying the brakes and bringing the train to a stop in the event of the motorman getting \\nincapacitated in any manner. This is arranged by means of a dead man\\'s device associate d with the \\nmaster controller.. With the reversing key in the \\'forward\\' or\\'reverse\\' position, the handle of the \\nmaster controller has to be kept continuously depressed by the motorman. If the pressure on the \\nhandle is released on account of the motorman fai nting or getting incapacitated in any manner, \\npower for the traction motors is cut off and the brakes are automatically applied.  \\n \\n2. Deadman\\'s device should be tested before commencement of every trip. An EMU train should \\nnot be considered fit for service  if the dead man\\'s device in any of the end driving cabs of a train \\nformation. is inoperative. In the event of the dead man\\'s device becoming defective when a rake is \\nin service, it should be either promptly withdrawn from service or a Guard, Train Examine r or some \\nother person conversant with the operation of the brakes in an emergency should travel with the \\nmotorman.  \\n \\n3. The dead man\\'s device will be operative when the train is in motion only if the reversing key is in \\n\\'forward\\' or \\'reverse\\' position. If  the reversing key is returned to the off position when the train is in \\nmotion, the dead man\\'s device is rendered inoperative with consequent serious danger of accident \\nin the event of the Driver fainting or getting incapacitated in any other manner. Motor men are, \\ntherefore, forbidden from moving the reversing key to the \\'off\\' position when the train is in motion.  \\n \\n4. It is essential to impress upon Motormen (during their initial training and whenever they attend \\nrefresher  course), the importance of this r ule. Frequent checks are also essential to ensure that the \\nrule is being  strictly observed by motormen during their working. This is one of the primary \\nresponsibilities of the Driving Inspectors.  Officers and other senior supervisory staff should also, \\nduring their cab, inspections specially check on the Motormen\\'s observance of the rule. Any \\ndisregard of, the rule should be dealt with severely and promptly.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME      [162]  30707 Auxilliary Warning System ( AWS)  \\n \\nThis system ensures extra vigilance on part of the drivers and in case of driver becomes \\nmomentarily inattentive it gives a warning bell and then applies the brakes automatically. Power is \\ncut out and brake operation also take place in case driver c rosses a stop signal at danger. The \\ndriving crew operating with the system should be made fully conversant with the same before being \\nput on loco /EMU, while working trains operating on sections fitted with such system.  \\n \\n30708 Joint Testing of Brakes by G uard and Motorman  \\n \\n1. Before an EMU train is brought on to a running line after inspection or maintenance in an EMU \\nshed or stabling line, the brakes of the train shall be jointly tested by the Motorman and the Guard to \\nensure that the electro - pneumatic,  automatic brakes and vacuum brakes (whichever is applicable) \\nare functioning normally and the brake pipe is continuous throughout the train.  \\n \\n2. This joint test shall be conducted in accordance with detailed local instructions laid down for the \\npurpose i n the Operating Manual for the particular type of EMU.  \\n \\n3. As far as possible this joint test should be carried out before the EMU train leaves the shed or \\nstabling line. However, if specially authorized jointly by CEE and COM, the brake test may be taken  \\non the platform before commencement of the first trip.  \\n \\n30709 Duties of Guards of EMU Trains  \\n \\nIn addition to the normal duties prescribed for them in General and Subsidiary Rules and other \\ninstructions, Guards of EMU trains shall be responsible for the following :  \\n \\na) Joint brake  test with the Motorman as  detailed in para 30708.   \\n \\nb) Switching on the lights and fans when required and making a general check at the \\ncommencement of the trip that lights and fans are An good working order in the train.  \\n \\nc) Conveying information to the maintenance staff regarding failures and defects of lights and fans \\nin the compartments.  \\n \\n30710 Defects in EMU Trains  \\n \\n1. Motormen are expected to be fully trained to rectify minor defects and in the method of isolation \\nof fa ulty equipment. Detailed instructions on the method of trouble -shooting and rectification of \\nminor defects are \\' contained in the Operating Manual of the respective type of EMU. Motormen are \\nexpected to keep themselves fully acquainted with details of thes e instructions and to rectify such \\ndefects themselves.  \\n \\n2. Defects such as failure of fans or lights, leakages in air pipes etc. will be attended to on arrival of \\nthe units in the Car shed or Stabling Depots.  \\n \\n30711 Defects Noticed During Run with Specia l Reference to EMUs  \\n \\n1. In the event of defects which affect the punctual and safe running of trains and require early \\nattention by the maintenance staff, the Motorman will convey a message indicating the exact nature \\nof defect to the Traction loco Contro ller through the Station Master of the nearest station and will \\nabide by the instructions given by the TLC. Depending upon the nature of defects, the TLC will \\ndecide whether the units are fit to be retained on line or should be withdrawn from service.  \\n \\n3. In the event of isolation of faulty traction motors, failure of auxiliaries etc., the maximum \\nspeed and other restrictions subject to which the train may be worked are detailed in the Operating \\nManual for each type of EMU.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS --- AC TRACTIO N MANUAL  VOLUME Ill    [163]  The  Motorman should abide by these instructions strictly.  \\n30712 Turn -round Time at Terminal Stations  \\n \\nAt terminal stations a minimum turn -round time of 6 minute should normally be allowed. This is \\nnecessary since norma lly the brake pipe pressure should be reduced to zero or vacuum destroyed \\nin case of vacuum braked EMUs at the end of the trip and normal pressure / vacuum built up again \\nwhen the train starts in the opposite direction. In exceptional circumstances, justif ied by local \\nrequirements , the CEE and COM jointly may permit a shorter turn -round time in which case it will \\nonly be possible for a partial reduction in brake pipe pressure/ partial destruction  of vacuum to be \\neffected at the end of the trip.  \\n \\n30713 Sta bling of EMU Trains  \\n1. When stabling an EMU train in the car shed or on a stabling line, the Motorman or Engine Turner \\nwho has  taken over the rake will carry out the following essential operations:  \\na) Switch off the lights and fans.  \\nb) Trip the main c ircuit breakers and drop the  pantographs.  \\nc) Destroy the brake pipe pressure or vacuum (as applicable), isolate the brake controller and return \\nbrake controllers to the “release” position  \\nd) Apply the hand brakes fully in the driving cabs at both the en ds. \\ne) Put off the main battery switch in the motor coaches.  \\nf) Lock the equipment compartments; and driving cabs.  \\ng) Any other operations prescribed under local instructions.   k@;-f ,                  .... ..   \\n \\n2. When a rake is to be stabled, the M otorman should invariably be at the leading driving cab. \\nBacking an EMU rake to a siding with the motorman at the rear cab is strictly forbidden.  \\n3. After stabling an EMU train or handing it  over to the Engine Turner, the Motorman before going \\noff duty s hould convey to the supervisor -in-charge of the Car Shed or stabling line (or to the TLC) \\nany defects or abnormalities noticed during the previous trips requiring immediate attention.  \\n \\n30714 Coasting with Special Reference to EMU Operation  \\n \\nIn order to k eep down the energy consumption for operation of EMU trains, it is necessary to resort \\nto coasting to the maximum extent feasible. The running time between stations given in the Time \\nTable is after allowing for sufficient coasting. For guidance of Motorman , Coasting Board indicating \\nthe point at which power may be cut off normally are fixed on the OHE masts facing the direction of \\nthe train movement. When the distance between a pair of stations is long, sometimes power may \\nhave to he applied in two spells. In such cases additional boards indicating at what point power has \\nto be switched on a second time and the point at which power may be switched off again are also \\nprovided.  \\n \\nIt is an important duty of a Motorman to observe the Coasting Boards to the maxim um extent \\nfeasible when the train is running on time. To make up time when a train is running late, the \\nCoasting Board may be disregarded and power kept on for a longer time, taking care not to exceed \\nthe permissible speed of the section.  \\n \\nIt must be reme mbered that if the \"switch -off\" Coasting Board is not observed when the train is \\nrunning to schedule, apart from waste of electrical energy, there will be greater wear and tear of \\nbrake block. The location of the Coasting Board on each line should be decid ed by Sr. DEE / DEE \\n(RS) after taking actual trials. A register  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill     [164]  should be maintained in the Office of Sr. DEE / DEE (RS) as well as TFR showing the locations of \\nthe Coasting Boards provided. These locations should also be advised to the ATFO (OHE) of the \\nsection who should ensure that the Coasting Boards are not shifted for any reason by OHE staff. A \\nperiodic check -that the boards are located correctly in accordance with the register should al so be \\ncarried out by the Driving Inspectors.  \\n \\n30715 Operation with Traction Motor(s) Cut Out  \\n \\na) Normally an EMU should be operated with all the traction motors in position.  \\n \\nb) In case it is important to operate an EMU with motor(s) cutout as a long te rm measure, the EMU \\nshould be operated at a restricted speed and coasting restricted and a revised time table should be \\nissued, if necessary.  \\n \\nc) For temporary cut out operation, motorman should inform the TLC and operate the train as \\ndirected i.e . to cle ar the section or to haul to destination or to complete the link till the EMU touches \\nthe maintenance shed. No EMU should normally leave the shed with any motor cut out.  \\n \\n30716 Working of Trains when Tracks are Flooded  \\n \\n1. The speed at which an EMU train  may be worked with various heights of water from rail level \\nshall be laid down for each type of EMUs under local instructions and incorporated in the respective \\nOperating Manual.  \\n \\n2. It must also be ensured that in areas liable to flooding, special gauge s (as laid down in para 716 \\nof Indian Railways Permanent Way Manual) are provided to indicate when different types of EMU \\nstock and electric locos have to be stopped.  \\n \\n30717 Push pull Operation  \\n \\nSome of the suburban trains are equipped with a locomotive in the centre not at each end. The \\noperation of such train is similar to EMU operation and the maintenance of the locomotive should be \\ncarried out in a loco shed and the various schedules as laid down should be followed.  \\n \\n30718 Long EMUs  \\n \\na) At times it may be necessary to haul long EMU train say two or more of 8 coach or 9 coach trains \\nas one unit. In such an event Railways will issue local instructions in the matter.  \\nb) It will be necessary to ensure that controls on each 8/9 coach trains are fed from the battery of \\nthe leading motor coach of the same train.  \\nc) CRS sanction may be required for such an operation.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill    [165]  CHAPTER VIII  \\n \\nCOMMISSIONING OF NEW ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES AND EMUs  \\n \\nPara No .

Bringing into use any new type of electric locomotive or EMU or to operate any in service at \\nspeed s higher than those already sanctioned. The term \"New Type\" includes:  \\n \\na) any alteration made in the existing rolling stock which will have an effect on the riding \\ncharacteristics of the rolling stock. Generally, the points to be considered are axle load,  unsprung \\nmass, primary and secondary suspension systems and load transfer arrangements between body \\nand bogies and bogies and wheel sets.  \\n \\nb) any alteration in the traction electrical system which is likely to interfere with signalling system.  \\n \\n30801 Co mmissioning of New type of Rolling Stock  \\n \\nWhen any new prototype loco/EMU are received for the first time from a manufacturer, the following \\nare required to be ensured for inducting the rolling stock into services safely: - .  \\n \\nFirst Stage: One time moveme nt of the Rolling Stock  \\n \\nThe new prototype needs to be certified fit for movement, based on an application made to the COM \\nof the Railway over which the loco is to be moved. The application is supported by -  \\n \\na) Certificate from RDSO regarding its overal l dimensions, axle loads, curve radius etc. for fitness to \\nmove on IR tracks.  \\n \\nb) Certificate from manufacturer of the locomotive from site of unloading/ interface with the zonal \\nrailway that the vehicle is fit to be moved.  \\n \\nc) A note on origin, destinat ion, route and special conditions of speed, escort, etc. under which the \\nloco is to be moved.  \\n \\nThe COM of the zonal railway issues a movement order authorizing the movement of the \\nlocomotive, based on the application, and any other conditions which he may  find essential to \\nstipulate.  \\n \\nSecond Stage: Provisional running  \\n \\na) RDSO at the first instance shall furnish Provisional Speed Certificate for the particular loco \\ntype. In this certificate RDSO will indicate the maximum provisional speed of the rolling sto ck \\npermitted to run with a particular type of track, nature of curvature, type of bridges, axle load, length \\nof the rolling stock, ODC dimensions if any and type of traction installations. RDSO will also furnish \\nthe infringements for which the loco is over  dimensional and Board\\'s condonation for the same is \\nrequired to be obtained.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL  VOLUME Ill    [167]  b) On receipt of the Provisional Speed Certificate, an application is made by the Chief Engineer of \\nthe concerne d Railway to the concerned CRS for obtaining sanction. This is accompanied by Safety \\nCertificate issued by CEE, CE, CSTE and CME. This certificate details restriction imposed and \\nprecautions to be observed for the movement of the loco. CRS          in   tu rn  will  then forward the \\nsame to the Secretary (Works), Railway Board along with his        recommendations. Engineering \\nDirectorate at the Railway Board will finally communicate the sanction based on the safety \\ncertificate issued by CEE, CE, CSTE, COPS and CME and comments of the concerned CRS for the \\nprovisional running of the rolling stock.  \\n \\nThird Stage: Instrumented trials  \\n \\nRDSO will furnish the details of test and trials to be carried out on the rolling stock, generally, \\nconsisting of the following ..  \\n \\na) Oscillation trials: The trials are carried out for assessing the speed potential, the riding quality and \\nstability at different speeds on straight and curved tracks of concerned sections. The parameters \\nwhich are generally measured on the oscillogr aph car are lateral forces, lateral and vertical \\naccelerations. Dynamic augment, bogie rotation and other parameters are derived. These trials are \\nrepeated for leading and trailing bogies with new and worn out wheel diameters.  \\n \\nb) Braking Distance Trials:  RDSO will conduct the braking distance trials with the loco hauling \\nprescribed loads at different speeds.  \\n \\nc) Tests regarding Interference with Signalling Circuits: The tests also will include measurements to \\ndetermine the interference to signal and tele communication circuits..  \\n \\nd) Performance trials : RDSO will conduct the trials to assess the performance ratings of the \\nlocomotives as per the extant instructions laid down.  \\n \\nFourth Stage  \\n \\nBased upon the results of trials RDSO will issue a Final Speed C ertificate indicating the maximum \\nspeed for which the new stock is considered fit, mentioning therein special precautions to be \\nobserved, if any. Based upon this certificate, the user Railway will issue a speed certificate signed \\njointly by CE, CEE, CME an d CSTE and send the same to concerned Commissioner of Railway \\nSafety (CRS).  \\n \\nFinal Stage  \\n \\nSanction of the Railway Board for commercial exploitation of the rolling stock is accorded.  \\n \\n30802 Trial Runs on Open Line  \\n \\nSubject to the condition that the oper ation of the particular new type of locomotive has already \\nreceived the sanction of the CRS, trial runs on the open line may be undertaken, taking all the usual \\nprecautions. The Driver should be a senior and experienced man who has acquired the \"feel\" of t he \\ntype of locomotive in question, as he would be in a better position to give his reactions as to the \\nperformance of the locomotive. Initially the locomotive should be run for short lengths at low speeds \\nand subject to various equipment continuing to oper ate satisfactorily, the length of run and the \\nspeed may be progressively raised over a period of, a few days. Test in particular how the brakes \\nfunction under the normal and emergency conditions. At the conclusion of each trip a detailed \\nexamination should  be made of the equipment, particular attention being paid to the temperature \\nrise, lubrication, protective devices etc. Every new rolling stock after initial run for a period of 15 to \\n20 days will be called back to the home shed and will be given a thorou gh inspection of all under -\\ngear equipment with special attention to loosening of bolts. These bolts will be re -tightened and \\nsecured before the rolling stock is put back into the system.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill    [168]  3080 3 Commissioning of New Electric Rolling Stock  \\n \\n1. Locomotives and EMUs do undergo, before dispatch, detailed tests and trials at manufacturing \\nunits which  include tests prescribed by RDSO. Nevertheless, it is necessary for officers and staff of \\nopen line  to check up the equipment thoroughly before they are put into commercial operation .  \\n \\nSr. DEE/ DEE(RS) and the staff should make a detailed inspection of all parts of the rolling stock, \\none equipment after another, keeping a full record of defects observ ed and action taken to rectify. \\nThe inspection shall be broadly based on IC schedules. In any case, a report should be forwarded \\nfor every loco or EMU tested, to manufacturers and to RDSO so that they may in turn improve the \\ndesign, revise the testing proc edure and tighten up for final  inspection. Such checks should also be \\nnormally carried out before commissioning a loco / EMU after an IOH/ POH by the shed / \\nworkshops.  \\n \\n2. Test certificates bound in book form issued by the Manufacturers / Production Units  should be \\navailable in duplicate. These should contain results of actual tests and measurements carried out on \\nthe different components, duly countersigned by the Inspecting Officers. One copy should be \\npreserved for reference in the loco shed and one cop y in CEE\\'s office.  \\n \\n3. The manufacturer is also required to submit guarantee / warranty of the loco components / sub -\\nassemblies wherever applicable. Whenever a new type of equipment / sub -assembly is  inducted \\ninto the locomotive, operation and maintenance  instructions shall be furnished by the manufacturer, \\nin advance, before dispatch of the locomotive.  \\n \\n30804 Electric Multiple Units  \\n \\nThe contents of paras 30801 to 30803 apply equally to every electric multiple unit, except that, in \\naddition to the elect rical equipment of the driving unit, the interconnecting pneumatic pipe \\nconnections and the brake equipment in each coach should be subjected to detailed examination for \\ndetection of leakage and. proper operation. Similarly the control cable connections be tween \\ncoaches should be checked for proper sealing at the ends to make them weather -proof. The running \\ngear and brake equipment in all motor and trailer coaches should also be tested.  \\n \\nInsulation resistance of the through wiring in the coaches, and intern al wiring for lights and fans \\nwithin the coaches should also be checked and recorded. Verify that the. different circuits are \\nprovided with individual fuses and the fuses are of the correct rating. All tests and trials should be \\nconducted with the EMU with out any passengers, except for the officials in -charge for testing ,  \\nloading of the train may be done by sand box, etc .  \\n \\n30805 Additional Precautions Before Commencement of Commercial Operation  \\n \\n1. During trial runs, very close watch should be kept of t he performance of new loco or EMU put into \\nnormal service. For the first few runs  , the Driving Inspector, together with. a few key personnel, \\nshould accompany the loco or EMU and examine the equipment at frequent intervals and arrange \\nfor rectification o f any defects which may show up. A separate History Sheet should be maintained \\nfor every electric locomotive or EMU.  \\n \\n2. The \"trouble -shooting directory\" should be got ready well in advance of introduction of a new type \\nof loco/ EMU and the running staff adequately trained in the trouble shooting methods and operation \\nof the type of loco/ EMU.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL -  VOLUME Ill    [169]  CHAPTER IX  \\n \\nSAFETY, BREAKDOWNS ANDDISASTER MANAGEMENT  \\n \\n \\nPara No    Subject  \\n \\n30900     Gener al  \\n30901     Knowledge of Rules  \\n30902     Emergency Stores and Break Down Equipment  \\n30903     Use of Hydraulic Re -railing Equipment of Electrified Tracks.  \\n30904     Break Down Gangs  \\n30905     Record of Staff Movements.  \\n30906     Summoning of Emergency Staf f  \\n30907     Expeditious Clearing of Track  \\n30908     Emergency Telephone  \\n30909     Flasher  Lights  \\n30910     Access  to the Roof of Electric Locos and EMUs.   \\n30911     Precautions to be Followed While Dispatching Locomotives as \\nVehicle.  \\n30912     Hauling a Dam aged Locomotive.  \\n30913     Haulage of a Disabled EMU Train.  \\n30914     Movement of Electric Trains Under Conditions of Flooded Tracks.  \\n30915     Accidents Involving Electric Rolling Stock  \\n30916      Look out for  OHE Defects  \\n30917     Pantograph Entanglement  \\n30918     Protection of Train in Case of Loco Failure and/or OHE Supply \\nFailure.  \\n30919     Parting of Trains  \\n30920     Firefighting Appliances for Electric Rolling Stock.  \\n30921     Fires in Electric Rolling Stock  \\n30922     Technical Investigation of Fires   \\n30923     Fire Accidents  \\n30924     Electrical Safety  \\n30925     Rehabilitation of Fire/Accident Damaged Rolling Stock  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill   [170]  CHAPTER IX  \\n \\nSAFETY, BREAKDOWNS AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT  \\n \\n30900 General  \\n \\nThe safety precautions to be taken have been dealt with great length in various parts of the Manual \\nparticularly in Chapters 2 to 7 dealing with Operation and Maintenance of Rolling Stock.

They should not be taken as nullifying or contradicting the \\ninstructions contained in other official manuals.      \\n \\n30902 Emergency Stores and Break Down Equipment  \\n \\nAt electric loco sheds and EMU sheds and at selected stations in the electrical sections, tools and \\nequipm ent such as special lifting jacks, traversing jacks, etc. for dealing with accidents to electric \\nrolling stock will be maintained. Sr. DEE / DEE incharge of sheds will be responsible for proper \\nupkeep of such equipment. They should inspect the same periodi cally and ensure that the same are \\nkept in working order and maintained properly. The list of tools and equipment to be maintained \\nspecially for dealing with breakdowns of electric rolling stock in use on the railways will be issued by \\nCEE.  \\n \\n30903 Use of Hydraulic Re -railing Equipment of Electrified Tracks  \\n \\nIn case of electrified tracks whenever the restoration is to be carried out and infringements are \\nrequired to be removed which in most cases will be the Rolling stock i.e. locomotive, coaches and \\nwagon s, it will be mandatory to use hydraulically operated jacks. The use of overhead crane will be \\nresorted to in case the hydraulic operated rerailing equipment, is unable to carry out restoration. \\nUse of overhead crane for restoration of services on electrif ied sections will only be permitted with \\nthe personal approval of DRM.  \\n \\n30904 Break Down Gangs  \\nIt is essential that adequate number of selected, experienced staff of all categories should be \\nhoused in railway quarters closed to loco sheds / EMU sheds, ou tstation depots and EMU stabling \\nlines etc. so that their services can be utilized for dealing with breakdowns and accidents whenever \\nrequired.  \\n \\n30905 Record of Staff Movements  \\n \\nSenior Supervisors of the Rolling Stock section should keep Traction Loco Co ntroller advised of \\ntheir movements to enable him to contact them in the event of an emergency of any breakdown \\ninvolving electric rolling stock.  \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill    [171]  30906 Summoning of Emergency Staf f  \\n \\nAddresses and telephone numbers of officers and staff of the Rolling Stock Section should be \\navailable with TLC. Station Masters should also keep the residential addresses of staff residing \\nnearby especially those who have no residential telephones, so  that they can be summoned when \\nrequired. Where special sirens are installed in railway colonies to summon emergency staff in the \\nevent of breakdowns or accidents, a special code signal may be employed for such summoning. \\nThe adequacy and proper observance  of these instructions should be checked at least once in \\nevery six months by sounding the alarm and recording the time taken for the key staff to turn up.  \\n \\n30907 Expeditious Clearing of Track  \\n \\nIn the event of a failure of locomotive or EMU, the primary objective should be to clear the line as \\nquickly as possible so that the repercussions on traffic are minimal. The Driver should follow the \\ndetailed instructions given in the respective trouble -shooting manuals. He should seek guidance \\nfrom TLC wherever ne cessary.  \\n \\nIn such cases it may be necessary to disconnect / disengage and even cut out the drive due to \\nwheel sets getting jammed. For expeditious clearing of the track, the locomotive may have to be \\ndriven at a reduced speed to be decided in consultation  with the engineering staff.  \\nIf the Driver is unable to move the locomotive or EMU on its own power, he should ask for a relief \\nengine or assisting train as the case may be.  \\n \\n30908 Emergency Telephone  \\n \\nThe driver of every locomotive shall carry with him  a portable emergency telephone set, so that in \\nthe event of a serious breakdown enroute in mid -section, he could contact the TPC/TLC from the \\nnearest emergency telephone circuit. To help the Driver arrow marks are painted on the faces of \\nOHE masts indicat ing the direction in which the nearest emergency telephone socket lies. Every \\nDriver shall be fully conversant with the method of plugging the portable telephone to its socket and \\nestablishing communication with TPC/TLC.  \\n \\nIn case telephone is not working the Driver will arrange to communicate the incident to the nearest \\nrailway station either himself or through Guard or Asstt Driver. In busy suburban sections, motormen \\nof disabled EMU trains can send messages to the nearest station through the Motorman or Guard of \\ntrains on adjacent track, which may be stopped by him for the purpose by showing hand signals. In \\ncase telephone is not working the Driver will arrange to communicate the incident to the nearest \\nRailway Station either himself or through Guard or A sstt. Driver.  \\n 30909 Flasher Lights  \\n \\nThese lights are provided on all locomotives and EMUs. As soon as the train stops due to \\nemergency application of brakes not initiated by the crew, the driver should assume that some \\nportion of his train has derailed and should put on the flasher light to warn the driving crews of the \\noncoming trains on the opposite track. The operation of the flasher lights may be suspended only \\nafter the crew have verified physically that the  neighbouring track is not infringing. Sim ilarly the crew \\nobserving the flasher light should take immediate action to stop the train even with emergency \\napplication of brakes if necessary and should only restart after the physical verification of the  \\ninfringement.   \\n30910 Access to the Roof of El ectric Locos and EMUs  \\n \\nOn Line  \\na) Access to the roof of electric locos and EMUs is authorized only under the conditions that the \\nOHE has been made dead and earthed on both sides of the loco /EMU by the OHE staff in \\naccordance with procedure laid down. Th e power block will he taken by the OHE staff.  \\n \\nb)On locomotives a ladder is provided for gaining access to the roof. The ladder is normally kept \\nlocked.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [172]  To remove the ladder from its l ocked position the Driver should operate the main isolating switch \\nand take out the key for unlocking the ladder. When the operations on the roof of the locomotive are \\nover the Driver should put back the ladder in its proper place. After locking the ladder  he can \\nrelease the key for operating the main isolating switch.  \\n \\nc) When required, for climbing from rail level, portable ladders are provided in each EMU. These \\nladders are fixed at a height at the ends of motor coaches. Though no special interlocking i s \\nprovided to prevent the ladders being used, the Motorman must ensure that the condition of para (a) \\nabove is satisfied before going on to the roof.  \\n \\nd)After the Driver/Motorman has completed his work, he shall ensure that everything is in order and \\nadvise the OHE staff to energize the line.  \\n \\nIn Sheds  \\n \\nThe supervisor incharge of maintenance gang shall ensure that OHE supply is switched OFF and \\nearthed before any staff is authorized to go on the roof of a locomotive/EMU. For this purpose, the \\nOHE shall b e made dead and earthed by opening the controlling isolator(s) fitted with earthing \\nheels. He will ensure physical contacts of earthing wheel and provision of padlock in this condition. \\nWhere the isolators are not provided with earthing heel, the line shal l be earthed an both the ends of \\nthe locomotive with the help of discharge rod. Having ensured this, he will allow the staff access to \\nthe roof who in turn will follow the following procedure :  \\n \\na) Each of the staff will collect padlock(s) with key(s) and  will sign in  a register maintained for this \\npurpose.  \\n \\nb) Handle(s) of the controlling isolator(s) already opened by the supervisor incharge will be further \\nsecured by providing individual lock(s) by the staff. Keys of the locks will be retained by the st aff till \\nsuch time the work is completed.  \\n \\nc)After completion of the work and when the last staff has removed his padlock(s) from the \\nisolator(s) and signed the register again; the concerned supervisor, after satisfying himself that all \\nstaff, tools etc. and the earths provided have been removed, may re -energize the OHE.  \\n \\n30911 Precautions to be Followed While Despatching Locomotives as Vehicle  \\n \\nElectric locomotives should not be worked as dead vehicles unless an authorised railway \\nemployees has taken al l the measures detailed in the respective Operating Manuals. Essentially \\nthese measures are lowering and isolating the pantographs, making all electrical equipment of the \\nloco dead, releasing  the brakes of the loco and closing the corridor and cab doors. I n such cases, \\nthe loco must he attached as the first vehicle of the train next to the engine. Para 30912 may also \\nbe referred in this regard.  \\n \\n30912 Hauling a Damaged Locomotive  \\n \\n1. If a damaged electric locomotive which is stabled on the open line or at  a station is to be hauled \\nas a dead vehicle, it must be certified by the Driver or EXR and must be accompanied by competent \\nstaff. In case of damage to the traction motor or transmission gear, the locomotive must be \\nexamined by an engine examiner and cert ified as fit for movement. The speed at which the \\ndamaged locomotive may be hauled in such cases should be as specified by the engine examiner.  \\n \\n2. On dead locomotive all the circuit breakers and battery knife switch shall be off and such other \\nsteps to e nsure that the dead locomotive cannot be started inadvertently.  \\n \\n3. Care shall be taken to ensure that traction motor reversers are physically placed and locked in \\nthe neutral position. For long distance movement of dead electric locomotives, the traction  motor \\nbrushes shall be lifted and secured before the loco is dispatched.  \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill                                              [173]  4. The locomotive brakes shall be fully released. The brake pipe  and main reservoir pressure shall \\nbe fully discharged or the vacuum fully destroyed. The MU2B valve, if fitted, shall be lifted and \\nproperly secured,  \\n \\n5. The dead locomotive shall be accompanied by a competent person not lower than an Asstt Driver \\nwhen a ttached to a passenger train and also when attached to the rear of a goods train. When \\nattached to the rear of a goods train, it will be the duty and responsibility of this person to apply the \\nhand brakes judiciously in case of run away occurring on a grad ed section.  \\n \\n6. The train driver shall be informed that he should work the train carefully as the dead locomotive \\nwill have no brake power at any time. If the dead loco is  to be hauled by a light engine, the speed \\nmay be required to be limited on account of limited brake power available on the light loco. This will  \\nbe laid down by the CEE of the railway.  \\n \\n7. The Assistant Driver of a train to which a dead electric locomotive has been coupled should keep \\nfrequently looking back to watch for any signal from  the staff accompanying the dead locomotive.  \\n \\n30913 Haulage of a Disabled EMU Train  \\n \\n1. Instructions contained in Para30912 for haulage of damaged loco shall apply  mutatis -mutandis \\nfor movement of a disabled EMU as well.  \\n2. An EMU train which cannot m ove on its own power but is otherwise fit to be moved, may be \\nhauled by another EMU train or a steam, electric or a diesel locomotive till it can be conveniently \\nside-tracked into a siding. Special adopters are provided to enable such emergency haulage of \\nEMU trains fitted with automatic couplers by means of locomotives. Drivers must be familiar with the \\nprocedure for fitting such adopters. The speed at which a disabled EMU train may be hauled under \\nsuch conditions will be as laid down in local instructions .  \\n3 The relevant General and Subsidiary Rules for moving disabled EMU trains should be rigidly \\nobserved.  \\n \\n30914 Movement of Electric Trains under Conditions of Flooded Tracks  \\n \\nWhen the tracks are flooded, the restrictions regarding movement of electric  locomotive and EMU \\ntrains shall be in accordance with local instructions (see also para 30716).  \\n \\nThe traction motor and associated parts including gear case, etc., are designed to permit propulsion \\nof rolling stock at 10 km/h through water upto a level o f 200mm above rail level. Further, the traction \\nmotors are made completely water -proof to a standing water depth of 760mrn above rail level.  \\n \\n30915 Accidents involving Electric Rolling Stock  \\nThe Traction Loco Controller should immediately inform the Off icer-in-charge of operation of Electric \\nRolling Stock in the event of any accidents involving Electric Rolling Stock. An Officer or Senior \\nSupervisor of the Electric Rolling Stock section should be invariably associated with restoration work \\nwhen derailmen t or other accidents to Electric hauled trains are involved. Before restoration \\ncommences the shed supervisor shall make measurements/ checks jointly with the engineering staff \\nto help investigation into the cause of accident later. For this purpose profor ma prescribed in the \\nAccident Manual or issued under the local orders of the railway should be used. Action shall be \\ntaken to preserve the evidence as far as possible. The restoration work of locomotive and train shall \\nonly be started after the TrD gives c learance.  \\n \\nThe checks to be carried out are detailed in the Annexure 9.01  \\n \\n30916 Look out for OHE Defects  \\nThe engine crew of all trains shall keep a sharp look out and report any defects in OHE noticed by \\nthem to the TPC from the nearest station. Such defects need not be confined to the line on which \\ntrain is moving but in the entire vicinity. They should give as detailed information as possible on the \\nnature of the breakdown, its location;  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill                           [174)  whether the masts have been uprooted, whether both lines in a double track section have been \\naffected etc. The OHE defects as  observed by the driver  may be of any one of  the following \\nclassification.  \\n1. Uprooting of or damage to  OHE masts on account of cyclone, derailments etc,  \\n2 Entanglement of pantographs with the OHE.  \\n3.Snapping of OHE conductors.  \\n4.Flash -over or other damage to insulators.  \\n5.Faults on account of stray wires etc.  \\n6.Theft of OHE conductors.  \\n \\n30917 Pantogr aph Entanglement  \\n \\nThe officer or supervisor of the Electrical Department arriving first at site of a breakdown, particularly \\nthose involving entanglement of pantographs with the OHE, should make a very careful note of all \\nrelevant details pertaining to th e break -down and also prepare a sketch indicating the particulars. \\nHe will also arrange for preservation of such evidence as may be useful subsequently for \\ninvestigating the cause of the breakdown.  \\n \\nItems to be checked on the pantograph and OHE are indica ted in the Annexures 9.02 and 9.03.  \\n \\nMaintenance Staff, after ensuring that OHE is dead, and earthed in association with OHE staff will \\nclimb on the roof of the locomotive. They will remove the HPT links of the damaged pantograph and \\nearth it and will sec ure the pantograph with wire rope from the base frame of the pantograph in such \\na manner that it does not come in contact with OHE during the run.  \\n \\n30918 Protection of Train in Case of Loco Failure and/or OHE Supply Failure  \\n \\n1. When overhead supply fails , the Driver shall endeavor to proceed on the momentum of the train \\nand see whether he can reach the next station otherwise he   will stop the locomotive close an \\nemergency socket. To help the Driver, arrow marks are painted on the faces of OHE masts \\nindicating the direction in which the nearest emergency socket. lies. If power supply is not restored \\nwithin 5 minute after stopping the train, he should make use of his portable telephone to ascertain \\nfrom the TPC through the emergency telephone socket the tim e when the supply is expected to be \\nrestored. If it is likely to be more than 15 minutes then the Driver should apply air and hand -brakes \\non the loco and pin down brakes on 10 wagons immediately behind the loco in the case of goods \\ntrains and all available  hand brakes in the case of passenger trains.  \\n \\nIf the Driver is unable to stop the train close to the emergency telephone socket, and is likely to take \\nmore than 15 minute to ascertain the time of restoration of the over head power supply from TPC he \\nmust  first protect the train against rolling as indicated above and then contact the TPC.  \\n \\nThe same instructions shall be observed in case of electric loco failure when it becomes necessary \\nto make the loco dead and call for assistance.  \\n \\n2. In addition, the precautions prescribed in General and Subsidiary Rules for protection of trains \\nwhen stopping out of course should be observed.  \\n \\n3. If after power is restored, the Driver experiences tripping again, he shall not energize the \\nlocomotive until he has person ally satisfied himself that there is no abnormality on his locomotive.  \\n \\n4. The locomotive will not be left unmanned in such an eventuality.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME III     [175]  \\n 30919 Parting of Trains  \\n \\n1. Failure of  inter -vehicle couplers can cause train partings. This can be due to sudden acceleration \\nor braking causing jerky motion of vehicles. Such jerks cause waves of alternate compression and \\ntension in inter -vehicle couplers passing down the train length and th e weakest coupler is liable to \\nbreak.  \\n \\n2. Drivers will observe following precautions to avoid parting of trains:  \\n \\na) When starting a train, tractive effort should be applied gradually to ensure that all the couplings \\nare fully tight.  \\n \\nb) Pick up speed n otch by  notch and start train smoothly.  \\n \\nc) Do not release brakes too fast after destroying vacuum by using double exhausters.  \\n \\nd) It is not enough to be guided solely by the vacuum gauge. Sufficient time (3 to 5 mt.) should be \\nallowed for full release o f vacuum brakes.  \\n \\ne) Do not use loco independent air brakes to stop trains.  \\n \\nf)Ensure engine coupling is properly tightened / locked before starting a train.  \\n \\n3. When a parting occurs the driver (in the front portion) should not endeavour to stop the fr ont \\nportion of the train, but should allow the portion to move forward to the extent possible to prevent \\nthe possibility of the rear portion colliding with the front portion. The automatic brakes applied on \\nparting may not be effective equally on both the halves of the parted train.  \\n \\n30920 Firefighting Appliances for Electric Rolling Stock  \\n \\n1. Every electric locomotive should be provided either with 2 number of 4 kg capacity or 4 number of \\n1. 25 kg capacity halon type fire extinguishers to IS: 11108, one in each cab and remaining in each \\ncorridor. The fire extinguishers shall be fixed on brackets at approved points in the cabs and \\ncorridors. The ATFR on duty will be responsible for ensuring that the locos leave with the full \\ncomplement of fire extinguisher s. Sufficient number of spare fire extinguishers should be available \\nwith the ATF(R) to replace defective and damaged fire extinguishers.  \\nIn exceptional circumstances CEE may authorize change in complement and / or type of the fire \\nextinguishers.  \\n2. On E MU, 2 number of 2.5kg. capacity Halon type fire extinguisher should be provided in each of \\nthe cabins occupied by motorman and Guard and also one number of Halon type extinguisher of the \\nsame capacity should be provided in each motor -coach of EMU. As in th e case of other passenger \\ntrains, the Operating Department will be responsible for custody of the fire extinguishers and their \\nissue to the Guard at the originating station of each EMU rake.  \\n3. All the staff of electrical department connected with the run ning and operation of trains should be \\nduly trained for fire fighting and use of fire extinguishers within the locos and EMUs.  \\n4. The staff should be trained in taking necessary precautions as enumerated in para 30921  \\n \\n30921 Fires in Electric Rolling Sto ck  \\n \\nPreventive Maintenance and Inspection  \\n \\n1. The presence of a large quantity of oil in the transformers and tap -changers of electric locos and \\nEMUs makes it possible for even minor fires to spread and assume serious proportion. Leakage of \\noil from exha usters and compressors results in accumulation of oil on the loco flooring causing \\nspread of fires. An essential step in  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [176]  prevention of fires in locos is, therefore, to control the leak age of oil from exhausters, compressors \\nand pipe lines and to arrange periodic cleaning of the locos to remove accumulated oil. Always use \\nfunnel of proper shape for tapping of oil to prevent spillage.  \\n \\n2. The arcing horns should be properly attended to d uring inspections. The arc -chute should be \\nproperly  secured and the securing arrangement periodically checked. The arc -chute should also be \\ncleaned during inspections.  \\n \\n3. In addition to periodic cleaning of the bogies and underframe to remove oily dust, it is also \\nimportant that rheostatic and regenerative braking, where provided, is kept in working order and \\ndrivers trained to make use of these on graded sections, obviating the need for heavy mechanical \\nbraking as far as possible thus preventing sparks f rom brake blocks.  \\n \\n4. Rating of fuses particularly of low voltage dc circuits are to be checked periodically to eliminate \\nthe possibilities of  the fire due to shot circuits/ overloads etc.  Always ensure that the proper sizes \\nand types of fuses are used f or replacement.  Check calibration of  MCBs during POH.  Use MCBs \\nand fuses of only approved supplier as laid down by RDSO.  \\n \\n5. Ensure that all the Protective relays are in good working order and are properly calibrated. Do not \\nbypass any protection on the  rolling stock.  \\n \\n6. A loose connection is  a potential source of fire. Proper tightness of all the connections is, \\ntherefore, to be ensured and this point is to be given particular attention during inspections. \\nCoaches commissioned after POH or new coaches  after commissioning should be thoroughly \\nchecked up for loose connection as during the first few days, loose connections will show up. \\nEnsure that all the connections secured with a nut and bolt are provided with a set of plain and \\nspring washers.  \\n \\n7. In sulation failures can result from surface flash overs due to presence of dirt and dust. It Is, \\ntherefore, essential that proper cleaning of terminal connections, bus bars, insulators and equipment \\nis done during schedules as laid down to remove oil and dus t.  \\n \\n8. Fires in control equipment cubicles are a problem and usually lead to considerable damage. A \\nparticular difficulty is the detection of fire and, therefore, the fire is likely to get a good hold before it \\nis noticed. Ensure that proper maintenance o f the equipments inside the cubicles is done and the \\nequipments are carefully looked at during inspection for any developing faults.  \\n \\n9. Batteries constitute some fire or explosion risk when they are being given a heavy charge. Heavy \\ncharging can be eithe r due to malfunction of the charging equipment or carelessness when charging \\nfrom the shop floor rectifier. It is therefore important to check that the ventilation provided in the \\nbattery box is  not choked. The staff should, therefore, be made aware of the  danger of \\novercharging.  \\n \\n10. Use only approved quality of cables and furnishing material for repairs. Proper care should \\nbetaken while laying down the new cables so that no damage to the insulation is caused.  \\n \\n11. In order to monitor healthy condition o f insulation of wiring and equipment, insulation resistance \\nshould be measured periodically in sheds and during POH in shops, and records kept.  \\n \\n12. In the event of fire it is essential that the main circuit breaker is tripped and the battery fuses of \\nlocomotives and EMUs are immediately removed to eliminate the continued feeding of the fault by \\nthe battery.  \\n \\n30922 Technical Investigation into Fires  \\n \\nEvery case of fire minor or major, irrespective of the location, whether in power, auxiliary or control \\ncircuits, should be investigated very carefully, even though an inquiry in accordance with the \\nAccident Rules may not be called for. The causes as established by the investigation should be \\nanalyzed by the Sr. DEE / DEE personally to identify areas requirin g further investigation and to \\ntighten up preventive measures. A report on each case of fire should  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME Ill     [177]  also be furnished to CEE. The general guidelines to check up  the items in locomo tive in the event of \\nfire, is given Annexure  9.04  \\n \\n30923 Fire Accidents  \\n \\n1. Fires in trains, whether carrying passengers or not, resulting in loss of human life or injury to any \\nperson or loss of or damage to railway property to the extent of or more th an the value prescribed \\nare required to be treated as \"accidents\" and have to be inquired into in  accordance with the \"Rules \\nfor Reporting and Inquiring into Accidents\". Fires in other railway premises resulting in damage to \\nrailway property of the prescri bed value or over are also to be treated as \"accidents\". Fire accidents \\ninvolving loss of human life or injury to persons or damage to railway property estimated to cost \\nequal to or over a prescribed value have also to be reported as soon as possible on te lephone to \\nthe Railway Board by the General Manager through Operating (Safety) Branch. Procedure laid \\ndown in the Finance Manual should be followed.  \\n \\n2. When electrical installations or electric rolling stock are involved or when there is possibility that  \\nthe fire was caused by electrical short circuit or due to defect or malfunctioning of electrical \\nequipment, a representative of the Electrical Department should invariably be a member of the \\ninquiry committee. Rules also require that a representative of t he Security Department should be \\nassociated with all inquiries into fire accidents. On arrival at the site of fire they will collect necessary \\nevidence and make out a joint report in consultation with the representative of the security \\ndepartment.   \\n \\n3. Th e composition of the inquiry committees and the method of disposal of the report of the inquiry \\ncommittee will be as laid down in the \"Rules for Reporting and Inquiring into Accidents\" issued by \\nthe Zonal Railways.  \\n \\n30924 Electrical Safety  \\n \\nProcedure for  reporting of electrical accidents and action to be taken have also been laid down in \\nVol. I of this manual. The various authorities to be informed in case of injury / death due to \\naccidental contact with live installations have also been indicated.  \\n \\nFollowing guidelines are specifically meant for Electrical Rolling Stock. These are to be observed \\nand in no way nullify or counter any of the instructions laid down elsewhere by the CEE in his \\ncapacity as Electrical Inspector to the Government of India.  \\n \\n1. All Loco / EMUs sheds should ensure that the various interlocks provided on the high tension \\ncompartments are effective and it is not possible to open HT compartment until the pantograph is in \\nlowered position and is fully earthed.  \\n \\n2. Drivers / Motormen should not enter the HT compartment unless the pantograph has been \\nlowered and fully earthed.  \\n \\n3. Drivers / Motormen should be fully trained in operations necessary to ensure electrical safety.  \\n \\n30925 Rehabilitation of Fire/Accident Damaged Rolling Stock   \\n \\nThe items need to be checked up before the electric rolling stock is taken for rehabilitation for its \\nsuitability is given is Annexure 9.05.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL – VOLUME     [178]   \\n   Annexure 9.05  \\n \\nITEMS TO BE CHECKED UP BEFORE  TAKING UP SPECIAL REPAIR OF FIRE/ACCIDENT  \\nDAMAGED LOCOMOTIVE  \\n \\nAll the items given below need attention for a locomotive involved in a major accident, affecting the \\nunder -frame. However, checking up of only under -frame and it em 3 is necessary in case a major fire \\ndamaged locomotive is taken for rehabilitation.  \\n \\n1. Electrical equipment  \\n1.1 Condition of tap changer plate, oil level in the gauge glass.  \\n1.2  25 kV condenser bushing for physical damage and oil leakage.  \\n 1.3  Fix ing/foundation bolt of all equipment.  \\n 1.4  Visual inspection for any damage.  \\n2. Mechanical equipment  \\n2.1 Under -frame  \\n(a) Visually inspect the underframe main sills for crack/local deformation/squareness.  \\n(b)   Measure height of couplers/buffers  \\n(c)  Measure impor tant dimensions of the underframe and examine for any bend/twist. The typical \\ndimensions which are required to be recorded for WAG -5 class of locomotive are given in Fig. 9.02 \\n(Sheet 1, 2).  \\n(d)  Measure camber by running a piano cord from end to end of th e locomotive. If there is a \\nnegative camber, the under -frame is likely to have under -gone a permanent set. It is normally not \\npossible to set right such deformation except when it is localised or is on a non -stress bearing \\nmember.  \\n(e)  Any separation betw een underframe and shell.  \\n(f_) Coupler, coupler pin, draft lugs (inside the coupler pocket) for crack/deformation.  \\n (g)  Holding arrangement of each equipment and shear checks, etc.  \\n2.2   Bogie and Brake rigging  \\n(a)  Visually examine the bogie frame and  brake rigging for any damage with special attention to \\ncracks.  \\n(b)  Measure all dimensions of bogie frame and examine for its deformation/squareness.  \\n(c)  Condition of the interfaces of the bogie frame with underframe.  \\n(d)  Condition of axle box roller bearing and horn liners.  \\n(e)  Bending of axle and traction motor shaft.  \\n(f) Cracks/deformation of equaliser beam, spring and spring seats.  \\n3.

Advantages of fered by these innovations in respect of operating performance and \\nmaintainability have also be indicated.  With a view to use developed technology of  3 - phase drives \\nsystem on Indian Railways, import of  3 - phase drive system locomotives with technology transfer \\nfor subsequent indigenous manufacturer is on hand.  \\n \\n31102 Conversion   Equipment   \\n \\n1. With the availability of thyristor of higher power handling capability use of tap changer is \\nbeing eleminated making the equipment entirely static.  This will not only reduced attention required \\nbut also enhance reliability.  Other very important benefit achieved by the thyristors is the capability \\nthey offer to control individually the supply to each motor permitting full utilization of the adhesion \\nexisting betwee n the wheels and the rails.  \\n2. Indian Railways have imported 12 locomotives from Japan and 6 from Sweeden with this \\ntechnology (WAG6 series).  Earlier a few experimental thyristors units were also fitted in existing \\nlocomotives, some of them with indigenous k now – how .  Indian Railways have also imported 25 \\nsets of thyristor control traction equipment for fitment on 25kV ac MG EMUs from UK.  These are \\nbeing fitted on 25kV ac MG EMU coaches at ICF, Madras.  Seven such thyristor controlled EMU \\nrakes are present ly in operation on MG Section of Southern Railway.  \\n \\n31103  Controls  \\n \\n With the advent of solid state devices in general, and microprocessors in particular, more \\nand more sophistication has become possible.  Other things remaining the same, with stepless \\ncontrol and consequent non -pulsating torque offered by such controls, higher average tractive effort \\ncan be achieved.  The solid state control is fast acting and methods are now available to detect \\nincipient slip and take corrective action before the slippage  becomes uncontrollable and curative \\naction is called for by reducing the tractive effort applied. Thus the locomotives can be made to \\ndevelop tractive efforts to very high levels of adhesion co -efficient.  \\n \\n31104 Drive  \\n1. One of the severe restrictions i mposed on the capability of electric locomotive is the dc series \\nmotors.  These motors have limitations on their use because of windings on the rotor and assembly \\nof commutators, making it vulnerable against centrifugal forces and requirements of satisfact ory \\ncommutation.  The 3 -phase asynchronous motor with a bar rotor does not  have the surface speed \\nlimitations.  The useful portion of its speed torque characteristics is only near its synchronous speed \\n.This useful portion can be spread over a wide range by varying the synchronous speed through \\nfrequency control.  \\n \\n2. With the advent of Gate Turn Off (GTO) thyristor problems associated with conversion of dc into \\nmultiphase ac system have been eliminated and use of 3 -phase synchronous/ asynchronous motor \\nhas become feasible.  “Variable Voltage and Variable Frequency” (VVVF) control has been \\ndeveloped and use of induction motors as traction drives has been tried successfully on the different \\nrailway systems.  With induction machines a maximum surface speed of 100 m/s is achievable and \\nan rpm level of 4500 has been accepted in the railways systems in Europe.  This considerably \\nincreases the output power of the traction motor for the same size.  This state of art technology has \\nyet to arrive in our country.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME III               [193]  \\n  3.

Necessity for increasing the throughp ut resulted in the design of BOX \"N\" wagons. With these \\nwagons, a trailing load of 4700 t has been optimized. Further improvements are under consideration \\nwhich may result in a maximum trailing load of 5100 t on the existing loop lengths. Also efforts are \\non hand to increase the maximum speed of these stock to 100 km/h. For trailing loads of 4700t, a \\n6000 HP locomotive with 45 t starting effort was taken as an optimum. Once the trailing load is \\nincreased to 5100 t and the speed potential to 100 km/h, the ho rsepower requirements further go up \\nto 8000 with a starting tractive effort of 50 t. Indian Railways will require a 8000 HP loco to meet the \\nincreasing throughputs of freight traffic.  \\n31106 Other Developments on Hand  \\n1.

Introduction   \\n \\nTill electronics came into the field of traction recently, the best suited drive for t raction application \\nwas the dc series motor because of its inherent characteristics to give high torque at low speeds \\nand vice -versa. The dc series motor was the best solution found for meeting the actual service as \\nwell as control requirements. On a fixed  frequency, the asynchronous motor has a characteristic \\nwhich is not well suited for traction application. However, this motor is of rugged construction when \\ncompared to a dc motor and requires much lower inputs for maintenance. Therefore its choice as a \\ntraction motor will always be preferred if control of the motor to suit the service requirements is \\npossible. With the development of GTO thyristors, power electronics and micro processor control, \\ncontrolling of any drive to suit specific requirements has b ecome quite easy. In the circumstances, \\nadoption of 3 - phase induction motor for traction application has been tried for the past 10 years and \\nhas now become commercially viable proposition. The control is being achieved through variable \\nvoltage and variab le frequency briefly referred to as VVVF. Originally thyristors were used with \\ncommutation requirements for cut off. With the advent of GTO, the control has been made much \\nsimpler and more efficient thus use of 3 -phase asynchronous motors for traction coul d also become \\nfinancially viable.  \\n \\nA locomotive With 3 -phase asynchronous motor drive has the following advantages  \\n \\n- higher power capability due to high power/weight ratio,  \\n- regeneration capability over a wide speed range,  \\n- lesser maintenance,  \\n- unity power  factor at pantograph,  \\n- higher adhesion.  \\n \\n2. Principle of control of 3 -phase drives.  \\n \\nThe speed/torque characteristic of an induction motor supplied from a 3 -phase voltage source of \\nfixed frequency   ‘f ’ is of the form shown in Fig. 11. 02.  \\n \\nIt may be seen that at low speed, the torque is small and the stator current is high. The zone \\nnormally usable lies at the extreme from the point of maximum torque, in the vicinity of synchronous \\nspeed. For traction applications a high TE is necessary for starting a nd accelerating the train. \\nTherefore, when constant torque is required, it is necessary to obtain whole series of characteristics \\ncurves such as shown in Fig. 11.03. This calls for change in synchronous speeds and therefore \\nvariable frequency.  \\n \\n3. Control  scheme for induction motors :  \\n \\nThe control of the ac induction motor drive in traction application is achieved in 3 stages.  \\n \\n1) Constant torque mode : The torque developed by a motor is proportional to the product of the \\nmagnetic flux in the air gap and  the rotor current. The applied voltage is proportional to the \\nsynchronous frequency and the magnetic flux in the air gap. To keep the magnetic flux constant, \\ntherefore, the applied voltage to the traction motor is, to be made proportional to the synchrono us \\nspeed.  \\n \\nThe rotor current depends upon the slip frequency of the rotor. By keeping this constant, the rotor \\ncurrent is also kept constant. This is possible till the voltage is increased to the rated terminal \\nvoltage of the traction motor. Thus in this mode the control is achieved by increasing the voltage \\nand frequency uniformly with respect to the actual speed of the rotation of the rotor and the required \\nslip frequency.  \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME III    [196]  \\n ii) Constant power mo de : In this mode the voltage is already reached to the rated voltage. By \\nincreasing the   \\nfrequency, the magnetic flux in the air gap is reduced proportionately. By keeping the slip frequency \\nconstant, the motor current is kept constant. Thus the motor is  made to give constant power output \\ntill the maximum service speed is reached.  \\n \\niii) Balancing speed stage: Once the maximum pre -determined speed is achieved, the same \\npower output from the traction motor may not be required and the output is to be matched to meet \\nthe resistance of the train for running at the balancing speed. This is achieved by suitably reducing \\nthe terminal voltage of the traction motor.  \\n \\nThese functions are performed through micro processor control giving various inputs of parameters \\nlike voltage, current and speed.  \\n \\niv) Convertor/Invertor System : In order to achieve the above control requirements, the \\nconvertor/ invertor system with a dc link is adopted. The convertor rectifies the ac voltage to dc and \\nfeeds it to the dc link. The dc lin k supplies power to the invertor. The convertor output power is \\ncontrolled by controlling the output current keeping the dc link voltage constant. The invertor output \\npower is controlled by varying the terminal voltage initially till the full voltage is ac hieved. However \\nthe motor output current is kept constant.  \\n \\nThe control of output current of the convertor and output voltage of the invertor is achieved by pulse \\nwidth modulation control.  \\n \\n \\nThe Power circuit diagram of a typical 3 -phase locomotive fitte d with asynchronous motors is shown \\nin Fig. 11. 01.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL - VOLUME III    [197]   \\n CHAPTER XII  \\n \\nTRAINING AND COMPETENCY CERTIFICATE   \\n  \\n \\nII.

TRAI NING  \\n \\n31200 Introductory   \\n \\nElectric traction is a specialized field. Efficient operation and maintenance of the traction \\ninstallations and equipment is only possible if the staff concerned have acquired an intimate \\nknowledge of the details of construction,  adjustments and operation of the equipment. A thorough \\nknowledge of the special rules and procedures on the part of the staff is also essential to ensure \\nsafety of equipment and personnel. These requirements call for a degree of specialized training for \\nall categories of staff before they can be safely entrusted with the responsibility for maintenance or \\noperation.  \\n \\nIII. 31201 Planning of Training in Advance  \\n \\nBefore electric traction is commissioned on any section, adequate strength of well -trained operating,  \\nmaintenance and running staff should be kept ready for operating the services. Planning the \\nrecruitment and training of such staff well in advance is  one of the most important tasks of the open \\nline administration. This applies in particular to steam/dies el running staff who would become \\nsurplus to requirements on introduction of electric traction and hence have to be absorbed as \\nrunning staff to operate electric rolling -stock. Timely release of such staff for training should be pre -\\nplanned and ensured by the Electrical Department in co -ordination with the Mechanical Department. \\nIt is also necessary to establish sufficiently in advance suitable training schools with qualified \\ninstructors and facilities for imparting the training.  \\n \\nIV. 31202 Categories to be Tr ained  \\n \\nCategories of staff for whom special training is required to be organized are generally as under -  \\n \\n1. Degree and Diploma holders recruited directly as Supervisors.  \\n \\n2. Apprentice Mechanics to be absorbed as Supervisors.  \\n \\n3. Trade Apprentices to be absorbed as skilled artisans.  \\n \\n4.  Diesel/ Steam Drivers to be trained as Drivers of electric locos and EMUs.  \\n \\n5. Artisans and supervisory staff to undergo Refresher Courses.  \\n \\n6. Running staff to be posted as TLCs etc.  \\n \\nV. 31203 Initial Training  \\n \\n1. C ategories of staff mentioned below should receive a period of initial training in a training \\nestablishment before they are posted to working posts -  \\na) Directly recruited supervisors.  \\nb) All categories of running staff, whether directly recruited or absor bed from steam/diesel sections.  \\n \\nC) Skilled and semi -skilled artisan staff for maintenance.  \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [200]  d) Any other category to be approved by CEE.  \\n \\n2. The period of initial training for typical cate gories is given below, which may be modified by CEE \\nin accordance with local requirements -  \\n \\na) Direct recruited supervisors (Degree and Diploma Holders) -  \\n \\ni) Electric Loco Section     18 months  \\n \\nii) EMU Section      12 months  \\n \\nb) Steam/Diesel Drivers t o be absorbed as Electric Running Staff -  \\n \\n1) Asst. Drivers      12 weeks  \\n \\nii) Grade \\'C\\'       20 weeks  \\n \\niii) Grade \\'B\\' or \\'A\\'       48 weeks  \\n \\nc) Skilled artisans for  maintenance -  \\n \\ni) Direct recruits      60 weeks  \\n \\nii) To be absorbed from Diesel/Steam  \\nor Electric general services     30 weeks  \\n \\n3. In addition to theoretical training, the trainees should receive thorough practical training on the \\nwork they will have to perform on completion of training . In all cases they should have a period as \\nunder -study to senior and experienced staff in actual execution of the type of work they have to \\nperform on completion of training.  \\n \\n4. For artisan staff the practical training should be oriented to enable them to understand and be \\nable to carry out independentl y skilled work of the type covered by \\'Inspection books\\', \\'Inspection \\ncharts\\', \\'trouble -shooting charts\\' and \\'technical charts\\'.  \\n \\nVI. 31204 Promotional Courses  \\n \\n1. No employee can be promoted unless he passes the trade test or other prescribed departmental \\ntest. The purpose of the semi -skilled category is to enable a man to study under the skilled man and \\ntake the trade test in due course.  \\n \\n2. When an employees is promoted, he should, as a rule, receive a period of training to enable him \\nto discharge his res ponsibilities in the higher post e.g., a semi -skilled fitter on promotion as a skilled \\nfitter. Such training should precede the departmental tests to determine suitability for promotion. The \\ntraining should be generally on the same lines as initial trainin g, but the period in most cases can be \\ncurtailed since the employee would already have a certain amount of background knowledge on \\naccount of his experience.  \\n \\nParticular attention should be paid to the older men, who although very proficient in the practi cal \\naspects of their work, are unable to pass the prescribed trade tests etc. in regard to the theoretical \\naspects because of their poor educational background. It often happens in consequence that they \\nare blocked for promotion although they are fit for p romotion in every other respect. By paying \\nindividual attention to such men and teaching them elementary tbeory, they could be made \\nsufficiently proficient to pass the trade tests in full. This not only ends their frustration, but boosts up \\nstaff morale as  a whole.  \\nINDIAN  RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [201]  VII. 31205 Refresher Courses  \\n1. In accordance with instructions current on the subject, refresher courses should be arranged.  \\nThis is obligatory for those categories of staff dealin g with \"safety of train operation or having daily \\ncontacts with the public\". The following is an illustrative list of staff corning within the scope of these \\ninstructions: -  \\n \\nDrivers, Asst. Drivers, Motormen, Shunters, Engine Turners, Supervisors and Arti sans responsible \\nfor examination and certification of fitness of running gear of locos and EMUs.  \\n \\nTLCs and Driving Inspectors  \\n \\n2. Similar refresher courses are also desirable for other categories of maintenance staff. The \\ncategories of staff for whom ref resher courses are to be arranged can be decided by the General \\nManager in accordance with para 117(a) of the Indian Railway Establishment Manual.  \\n \\n3. The object of the refresher courses is to reinforce the knowledge of the staff and bring them up -\\nto-date in regard to the latest rules and procedures and instructions regarding operation and \\nmaintenance in the light of operating experience. The duration of the refresher course for each \\ncategory may be decided by CEE to suit local conditions. The duration for  typical categories is given \\nbelow for guidance -  \\n \\na) Supervisors     3 weeks  \\nb) Drivers/Asst. Drivers    3 weeks  \\nc) Artisan Staff     2 weeks  \\n \\n4. For categories of staff liable for inter -divisional transfers, programming of refresher courses \\nshould be arranged by the headquarters office. For staff confined to a particular division, the \\nprogramming should be done at the divisional level.  \\n \\n5. Apart from rules and regulations, the refresher courses for running staff should lay emphasis on \\ntrouble - shoo ting procedures for various types of locos and EMUs. Drivers have to deal with some \\ntypes of failures only rarely and hence they tend to forget the details. Though such details are given \\nin the Trouble -Shooting, Manuals, actual drilling during the refreshe r course will be of great benefit. \\nThis involves repetition of the same exercise several times so as to make a lasting impression and \\nnot to be forgotten easily.  \\n \\n6. During the refresher courses, it will be very useful to arrange group discussions amongst  the \\ntrainees on specific problems encountered during the course of work. Such group discussions will \\nbe of great assistance in view of the opportunity for exchange of information based on actual \\nexperience in working.  \\n \\nVIII. 31206 Facilities for Training  \\n \\n1. Facilities have been provided on an All India basis for the intensive specialized training of officers \\nand staff of the Electrical Department. In addition the facilities available with the different Zonal \\nRailways have to be utilized to best advantage.  \\n \\n2. Training schools for Drivers are attached to major electric loco sheds. These schools should be \\nused to a limited extent for training of artisan staff and supervisors. Apart from cut -models, charts, \\ncircuit diagrams etc. the training schools should conta in ‘simulators\\' to demonstrate the functioning \\nof locos, the circuit combinations resulting from operation of the master controller etc. These \\nsimulators should be used to drill the trainees in the correct method of operation and systematic \\ntrouble -shootin g.  \\n3. The \\'simulator\\' provided consists of the HT and LT control apparatus as provided in the locos and \\nworking models of items such as pantograph, tap -changer etc. A driving cab similar to the cab in a \\nloco is available, complete with master controller,  brake controller, control switches, gauges, \\nindicator lamps etc. From this driving position  \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [202]  the equipment in the simulator can be operated to demonstrate the functioning of the various \\ncompo nents. By actually handling the controls, the trainees can learn the correct sequence of \\noperation and get a \\'feel\\' of the equipment as actually functioning.  \\n \\nThe Instructor can reproduce faults similar to those occurring in actual practice e.g., tripping  of \\ncircuit breaker due to overload, earth faults, traction motor faults etc. The trainees can get familiar \\nwith the correct method of trouble -shooting as detailed in the trouble -shooting directory and by \\nrepeated practice become fully acquainted with the correct procedure.  \\n \\n4. In any traction training establishment, the essential equipment to be provided for instructional \\npurposes should include the following -  \\n \\na) Special tools and instruments used in electric traction.  \\n \\nb) Cut -models to show constructi onal details of equipment.  \\n \\nc) Circuit diagrams, sectionalising diagrams, etc., preferably illuminated and arranged to show the \\nsequence of operations  \\n \\nd) Samples of damaged equipment with tablets explaining the nature of failures and preventive \\nchecks.  \\n \\ne) Publicity boards with slogans and illustrations emphasizing safe methods of working,  \\n \\nf) Boards illustrating \\'Do\\'s\\' and \\'Dont\\'s\\'.  \\n \\ng) Preferably full working models.  \\n \\nIX. 31207 Training in General and Subsidiary Rules  \\n \\nElectric running staff as well a s supervisors, when required, should receive initial training as well as \\nrefresher courses in General and Subsidiary Rules normally in the Zonal Transportation Schools, \\nwhich usually have excellent model rooms to facilitate the proper understanding of the rules and \\nsystems of working. In exceptional cases when such training cannot be arranged conveniently in the \\nZonal Schools, CEE may authorize the training in GRs & SRs to be included in the syllabus for \\ntraining in Loco Training Schools. Separate Instructo rs well -versed in the subject should, however, \\nbe provided invariably.  \\n \\nX. 31208 Responsibility of Officer and Supervisors  \\n \\nApart from those in -charge of training establishments, other officers and supervisors in -charge of \\noperation and maintenance should a lso take a keen personal interest in the training of all grades of \\nstaff attached to them. They should deem it as part of their duty to guide the trainees and watch \\ntheir progress. Training is a continuous process which helps the officers as much as the tr ainees not \\nonly in developing contacts on a personal level, but also in understanding the finer points of \\noperation and maintenance. A record of progress achieved, the period of training given etc. should \\nbe maintained for every trainee.  \\n \\nXI. 31209 Examinatio n at the end of Training  \\n \\nAll trainees should pass prescribed examination on completion of training. The scope of \\nexamination and the level of officers and supervisor responsible for examining will be laid down by \\nCEE. The examination should have a practi cal bias. The examination of Drivers, for instance, \\nshould include practical tests in trouble shooting as well as correct driving and braking techniques.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nINDIAN RAILWAYS - AC TRACTION MANUAL VOLUME Ill     [203]  XII. 31210 Specialized Training  \\n \\n1. Selected supervisors and officers from the user railways should be deputed to CLW and ICF to \\nbe associated with the production of each batch of electric loco and EMU stock. Such association of \\nthe maintenance staff at the production stage will be of grea t help in giving them an insight Into \\nconstructional details of the equipment.  \\n2. Similarly when large contracts are entered into for supply of electric traction equipment \\nincorporating new designs and technology, it is usual practice to include in the co ntract a clause \\nwhich permits some staff of the consignee railways to be deputed to the manufacturer\\'s works \\nduring the production stage for practical training on the equipment, so that they may get thoroughly \\nacquainted with the operation and maintenance of the equipment, taking advantage of the training \\nfacilities available with the contracting firms.  \\nXIII. 31211 Syllabi  \\nGuidelines for syllabus of two categories of staff are given below.
